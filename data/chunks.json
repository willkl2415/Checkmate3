This provides information on the resources used for training, with a forward projection of resource requirements and, potentially, costs. An important aspect of the Templates module is that it enables the capture of information necessary to improve management of resources, balancing their use to achieve greater efficiency. Templates also provide links into courses to automate InVal. As a minimum, Training Providers are to show each course in sufficient detail to support an accurate assessment of the utilisation of trainers and those key resources with a significant associated cost. The design of courses that call on several different, costly resource types for different lessons/events will need to be prioritised for production in more detail.

This will suggest the appropriate choice of Method (e.g. a Skills-based EO must have some element of practice involved in the Method; whilst role-play is an example of a training Method suitable for a Behaviour-based EO). The aim must be to choose a Method that is compatible with the material to be learned. Learning a physical Skill may require equipment and machinery and a low trainee-to-trainer ratio as it tends to be trainee-centric. Knowledge learning is most effective and efficient via e-learning, in the form of a lecture, or with links to information.

An agile force is one whose people learn continuously, from experience and from each other, as well as from training courses. Learning in the workplace is just as important as learning on a course and requires the support of qualified trainers. Whether in the workplace or a training establishment, the underlying principles and standards for the delivery of Defence training remain the same. Training provision is the process conducted by the Training Provider that enables and allows trainees to learn. It is the outputs that ensure trainers are trained, learning activities are piloted, programmed and resourced, learning is prepared for, training deficiencies are managed, risks are assessed and trainees are appropriately cared for."

Trainees who self-regulate their learning are motivated to learn through-life and are confident of their ability to learn, and so they are more likely to take action to remain competent and current in their job role. Trainers can teach trainees to self-regulate by prompting them to set and reflect on individual goals, using feedback to then identify and review what they did to achieve the goal. Concentrating more on what the trainee did (or did not do), rather than the actual outcome, helps to develop these self-monitoring capabilities. Learning from mistakes is also a very effective tool in self-regulated learning and trainees need to be given the freedom to make mistakes where safety, time and resources permit."

Trainers can teach trainees to self-regulate by prompting them to set and reflect on individual goals, using feedback to then identify and review what they did to achieve the goal. Concentrating more on what the trainee did (or did not do), rather than the actual outcome, helps to develop these self-monitoring capabilities. Learning from mistakes is also a very effective tool in self-regulated learning and trainees need to be given the freedom to make mistakes where safety, time and resources permit."

While the use of learning technology can be a very powerful training tool in the right circumstances, it should only ever be used where it enhances learning and never just for the sake of it. TEL is a particularly fast-developing area, which now covers a much broader and more complex range of technologies, meaning that there are an increasing number of ways in which technology is being exploited across Defence. Learning technology is currently used to support learning in the classroom, to provide information (for knowledge-based learning) before the classroom activity, to provide training remotely, to provide realism in training and to increase trainee engagement. Trainers must be able to employ common technology in their lessons, and may be required to support trainees using technology in other contexts, e.g. e-tutoring, Computer Aided Instruction (CAI), Computer Based Training (CBT), or use of simulators."

Trainers should always use an up to date ASpec when planning an assessment. The main purpose of the ASpec is to control what is assessed and how. It is important Trainers assess all of the EOs and KLPs as specified in the ASpec and not make any changes that alter these. The manner in which the assessment is conducted is determined by the ASpec. Designers strive to provide as much realism as possible, sometimes by using simulation, instrumented or scenario-based activities and so unauthorised changes to the realism of a practical assessment may make it invalid. If limited resources make it difficult to deliver the assessment in the recommended way or the ASpec appears too restrictive, the DTS, DTM or Chain of Command should be informed."

Defence people work in hazardous environments, under stressful conditions whilst conducting activities that carry a high risk to personal safety. Consequently, Defence must ensure that its Training Systems meet the very highest standards. Training must also be robust, realistic, and challenging if it is to prepare its personnel for the full spectrum of Defence Roles. However, there is a tendency, because of the risk, for Defence training organisations to provide more training than necessary in the misguided belief that this will make up for future uncertainties. And, in some cases, poorly designed or executed Training Systems can deliver insufficient training. The ideal then is a Training System that is designed to train its personnel to an optimal level so that they are equipped with the appropriate Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes (KSA). Providing too much training costs money that will likely be taken from elsewhere in the training budget that could then result in insufficient training in other areas, which risks lives. Therefore, a Training System designed using a common process and that is governed and managed in accordance with the Defence mandated QMS, is vital to ensure that Defence people are best equipped to achieve Defence effect."

The Safe System of Training (SST) does not replace Health and Safety legislation, nor the guidance offered by the Health and Safety Executive; rather, the SST should be read in conjunction with JSP375. The SST is derived from the Safe System of Work (SSW) and sets the conditions under which Defence training is to be conducted, ensuring personnel are provided with the appropriate information, instruction, and supervision. This enables Defence to meet the training imperative set by the Operational Requirement, whilst ensuring that personnel given the best possible preparation for the roles they may undertake. The SST enables Defence to maintain training risks at As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) by ensuring those who conduct the training are competent and that all risks, and associated mitigation measures have been considered. Further direction and guidance on SST policy is being developed and will be published as soon as practical."

Undue pressure should not be put on managers or those delivering training to deviate from planned and endorsed training programmes. Those responsible for the management and delivery of training should have the ability to amend training as necessary, to meet changing environmental conditions (e.g. avoiding excessive heat), equipment deficiencies or shortfalls in resources. However, careful consideration must be given to the resultant risk, especially where it has an impact on safety that increases the risk to life and could result in death or serious injury. It is imperative that the delivery of training remains progressive and subject to a safe system of training throughout. Changes to planned training delivery such as truncating, accelerating or other variations (changing location, time, or content etc) can affect the rate at which training proficiency is achieved, potentially increasing the associated risk. In many cases certain proficiency criteria must be met by trainees to be able to perform tasks in a consistent, reliable, and repeatable manner that meets established standards, facilitating the progression in training and enabling post training activities. This is of paramount importance for any critical training which, if not conducted to the correct standard, increases the risk to life and could result in death or serious injury. Any change to the content, time, or resources available for such critical training must be subject to an approved risk assessment by the Commander, Line Manager or accountable person."

This may occur within a training day or training course as activities are changed and amended, with the trainer or supervisor required to keep track of the impact on safety as well as the training standard and welfare of all those involved. Cumulative risk incorporates other areas such as support and management, where there is no longer the capacity to maintain the existing training or update it to meet changing requirements (e.g. input standards) or fully implement the recommendations from reviews. For example, the informal act of a changing task (change in task complexity, omitting a particular step, changing the conditions set out in the planned activity) - although necessary, may have introduced additional risks that were not recognised- either in facilitating training, or in the need for suitable progression for the trainees. In addition, gapping in the training support area may mean this change is never updated in the DSAT mandated documentation and hence it is not reviewed and authorised. Operational pressures and resource constraints may then mean this shortfall is continually repeated in several areas and informal changes become normalised: the training delivered may be required but does not match the authorised and documented instructions and procedures being managed and resourced. Such cumulative risk must be recognised, escalated through the chain of command, and actioned as necessary."

Normally the most valuable source of RA data, the most appropriate SMEs are likely to be drawn from role holders (), line managers, trade managers, technical specialists (internal and external) and manufacturers. In some equipment acquisition scenarios, the manufacturer or users outside of Defence may be the only sources of data. Analysts should not be wholly reliant on others to provide them with SME contacts; they should be proactive in seeking, identifying and engaging with as many SMEs as necessary to provide a balanced opinion of issues and potential training options. Although, ultimately the responsibility for providing access to SMEs does reside with the TSG."

Several approaches of costing the impact of OJT might be used: OJT could be counted in terms of the cost of providing the OC, for example the cost of 3 days OJT for Command Team Training might be assessed as 3 days of running costs for the particular platform. The cost of OJT might be calculated in terms of interruption to ship\u2019s activities multiplied by capitation rates of those"

No hard and fast rules for interpreting the data can, or should be given as the circumstances for individual projects can differ. Certain tasks might be deemed critical in which case an option which was otherwise compliant (MOTE \u2265 0.8) might be rejected as it was deficient in these areas and similarly the converse might apply. Fundamental to a satisfactory TOA is the analyst\u2019s ability to present a coherent and reliable case."

The original approach involved decomposing a task into subtasks and identifying the \u2018predominant psychological domain\u2019 for each subtask. This approach failed to acknowledge that the predominant domain is not always that which is most susceptible to skill fade. It also prevented identification of where combinations of two or more domains underpin subtasks or where skills are integrated. In this handbook, CRA now requires decomposition of a task/Training Objective (TO) into subtasks/Enabling Objectives (EOs) and task elements/Key Learning Points (KLPs). Decomposing tasks down to the task element/KLP level enables a detailed identification of the knowledge and skills needed for an adequate understanding of the task. By doing so, it becomes possible to identify the psychological domain most susceptible to decay and map that to the subtask/EO, rather than the predominant domain."

These are presented in Table 14, including their effect on retention. It is necessary to have an understanding of the context in which a subtask/EO is conducted. Therefore, a panel of SMEs should consider how these factors can be integrated into training design and delivery. The Conditions and Standards associated with the list of Performance Objectives should be articulated within the RPS and this information can be used as a supporting input to Step 5. Implementation of these influencing factors will support the management of implicit knowledge and complex cognitive skills retention."

    "content": "The acquisition and retention of implicit knowledge and complex cognitive skills that underpin complex tasks is enhanced by the development of a strong mental model. A mental model is a mental representation of a task, which captures how it is understood or conceptualised and performed. It includes an understanding of the task components and the purpose(s) of the whole task and its subtasks/EOs, the conceptual relationships between subtasks/EOs, and how they work together during performance of the whole task. Developing a strong mental model is a key factor influencing the acquisition and retention of implicit knowledge and complex cognitive skills. This is because a strong mental model provides the conceptual \u2018glue\u2019 required to bind subtask/EO components (i.e., task elements/KLPs) in long-term memory. It also aids the encoding of task complexity. The positive effect on retention of the other influencing factors summarised in Table 14, is dependent on the acquisition of a strong mental model."

The more complex the task, the more important it is for the mind to be able to develop, retain and update the mental model for the task. In general, individuals are not conscious of their task mental models and do not explicitly articulate them. However, mental models for any task can be explicitly articulated through analysis to identify what has to be learned. By analysing the mental model, the conceptual relationships between the subtasks/EOs can be identified. These can then be specified as additional KLPs and incorporated into the training design and delivery. It is important to note that these KLPs would not have been identified using traditional KSA analysis techniques."

To illustrate, setting up the ironing equipment can be conducted independently of thinking about the other subtasks/EOs. Mental models for simple tasks do not need to be made explicit during training. This is because the retention of simple tasks is determined by working memory capacity i.e., memory for procedurals and/or stepped decisional processes."

The subtasks/EOs of complex tasks can be performed separately or concurrently, but conceptual relationships will exist between two or more of the subtasks/EOs. Complex tasks require the acquisition of a strong and flexible (i.e., adaptable) mental model. To support acquisition and retention of a complex task, it is important for training designers to explicitly specify this task mental model. This can be done by developing an external representation, which illustrates the conceptual understanding that has to be developed in the learner through practice. This then allows the training designer to identify the conceptual learning points which will support subconscious acquisition of the task mental model."

This is because the CRA-T is based on the UDA predictive skills retention model, which was originally developed for tasks requiring the recall of procedures and stepped processes. In addition, although this predictive skills retention model has received some validation, it has not been widely validated and is known to be pessimistic. In general, the UDA predicts on average a smaller percentage of a workforce will be competent than the actual performance data would suggest. For some tasks, this difference has been as large as 30% (Rose, Czarnolewski et al., 1985)."

Although the UDA is based on task-related factors that are known to influence the retention of explicit knowledge, physical and simple cognitive skills, the algorithm applied in the generation of its decay curves is based on the aggregation of individual performance data. Therefore, the decay curves represent the percentage of a workforce predicted to remain proficient after a period of time has elapsed since the knowledge or skill was last applied. Given the CRA-T extant retention levels are based on UDA-generated retention curves, they do not indicate knowledge and skill fade at the level of the individual. It follows that the CRA-T retention levels cannot be used to identify the point at which an individual\u2019s performance would fall below criterion."

They also assume that the workforce has received the same training, to the same standard, and that personnel meet the same level of proficiency at the time of skill acquisition. To address these limitations, new decay explanations of knowledge and skills retention must be based on individual retention of acquired knowledge and skills over an extended period of non-use. Key to the generation of individual skills retention curves is the requirement for a standardised approach where the same individuals: i) are at or above a criterion performance level; ii) have had equivalent training experience during acquisition; and iii) have been assessed at the point of acquisition and after a specified retent ion interval(s). Guidance for the collection of longitudinal empirical evidence is covered in a Top Tips document for the Planning, Conduct and Analysis of Future skill Fade research (Cahillane & Anderson, 2021)."

The re- classification of KSA in terms of the psychological knowledge and skill domains outlines knowledge, skills and attitudes in a manner that is consistent with advances in the psychological literature on human cognition (Green & Bavelier, 2015; Sanli & Carnaham, 2018; Stasielowicz, 2019).

Simple cognitive skills include the Procedural skills domain, which represents the ability to remember a sequence of steps and their order to execute a task. There are minimal physical demands. For example, when using a BIMS to create map overlays, the physical component only constitutes using a mouse and the procedural aspect dominates. This distinguishes procedural skills from discrete psychomotor skills such as weapon handling, which have greater physical demands and require the recall of a sequence of actions. Simple Decision-making involves a series of processes involving analysis and evaluation with discrete outputs that have a definite beginning and end and result in a decision. The options available during a simple decision- making process are usually binary, such as 'Yes' and \u2018No\u2019 when a decision tree is followed, for example, combat casualty drills."

It sits above the other skill domains and represents the ability of an individual to manage their attention in order to perform within two or more different psychological skill domains concurrently. The Integrative domain is required for subtasks where the task elements match a combination of two or more different psychological skill domains that are performed concurrently (i.e., integrated). An example is a firefighter responsible for responding to an incident (simple decision-making) and deciding what and how information should be communicated to multiple agencies (complex decision-making), whilst managing events immediate to the scene of a fire (procedural skills). Note that the procedural skills and discrete psychomotor skills cannot be integrated (i.e., performed concurrently). This because discrete psychomotor skills involve the recall of a sequence of motor actions. Hence, higher motor demands are combined with moderate cognitive demands (i.e., procedural skill). An example of two simple cognitive skills that might be performed concurrently (i.e., integrated) are continuous psychomotor and adaptive cognition, for example, a UAS pilot having to adapt their thinking in order to drive behavioural, i.e., continuous psychomotor output. The UAS pilot has to adapt to constant changes in the information being fed back to them by the sensors, which they are simultaneously controlling."

The moderate cognitive demand relates to the need to recall cognitive processes or explicit information."

    "content": "Retention is improved where the physical demand is higher. Skills are retained better when they require a combination of moderate to high physical demands and moderate cognitive demands, for example, discrete psychomotor skills such as weapon handling drills. These types of skills require rote memory for cognitive stepped processes and procedures, and their rehearsal to aid their acquisition and retention."

Complex cognitive skills place much higher demands on cognition, irrespective of physical demand. The higher cognitive demands account for the reduced skill fade found to date for complex cognitive skills. To date, only one study (Sanli & Carnahan, 2018) has considered the retention rate of complex cognitive skills and reported retention up to 6 months after initial training. Hence, there is currently insufficient evidence to define retention levels for complex cognitive skills."

However, research shows that when prompted after the incident, incident commanders can articulate their implicit knowledge."

It is a systematic, iterative, output based approach that provides an audit trail of analysis to determine the requirement for training and, if required, enable design of specialist training and acquisition of training equipment/services. The process takes a three-phase approach with a number of stages and deliverables. It is essential that the training solution recommendations include implementation and acceptance requirements and plans sufficient to move the next phase of the project forward cost effectively, in line with timescales and resources available."

In all cases, however, a TNA is an output based, iterative process that provides an audit trail for all decisions and is closely mapped to the requirements of the QMS.  A TNA does not, and should not, imply that training will be the only solution.  If training is not the solution, this will become apparent in the Planning Stage, after which, analysis activity will cease. It should be noted that a TNA may range from a simple interview to a process lasting several months."

Those responsible for the management and delivery of training should have the ability to amend training as necessary, to meet changing environmental conditions (e.g. avoiding excessive heat), equipment deficiencies or shortfalls in resources. However, careful consideration must be given to the resultant risk, especially where it has an impact on safety that increases the risk to life and could result in death or serious injury. It is imperative that the delivery of training remains progressive and subject to a safe system of training throughout. Changes to planned training delivery such as truncating, accelerating or other variations (changing location, time or content etc) can affect the rate at which training proficiency is achieved, potentially increasing the associated risk. In many cases certain proficiency criteria must be met by trainees to be able to perform tasks in a consistent, reliable and repeatable manner that meets established standards, facilitating the progression in training and enabling post training activities. This is of paramount importance for any critical training which, if not conducted to the correct standard, increases the risk to life and could result in death or serious injury. Any change to the content, time or resources available for such critical training must be subject to an approved risk assessment by the Commander, Line Manager or accountable person."

Where risks or issues resulting from identified training deficiencies cannot be mitigated by the Training Provider, such training deficiency-based risks should be elevated for treatment or toleration etc.  Identifying and raising training deficiencies shows the stakeholders where training shortfalls exist or where risks have been taken owing to either an inability to train certain TOs (due to weather constraints or equipment casualties, for example) or a training failure that has been picked up through the assurance process.  Such deficiencies suggest that trainees may not hold the competences that the training should have delivered.

The DSAT QMS is the standard that is met when the outputs of the DSAT Elements and the MTS activities are implemented correctly.  DSAT assurance needs to focus on the mandated requirements of the MTS and the mandated requirements of individual training. Information, which must be managed iaw JSP 441, will support the assurance process."

The aim therefore of Robust Training events is to develop physical and mental resilience in order to prepare appropriately for the challenges of operations worldwide.

The purpose of Robust Training is to progressively develop a Service Person\u2019s (SPs) resilience to enable them to perform effectively in any operational environment.  The degree to which Robust Training is employed within an Initial training programme should reflect the employment of that SP in both specialist and generic tasks.  Emphasis should be placed upon the need for SP to perform in the most demanding conditions in which they may realistically expect to find themselves if deployed to high-tempo and/or high-threat operational environments.  As Defence transitions to a contingent posture, the non-linear nature of the Contemporary Operating Environment (COE) will inevitably expose SP from support functions to higher risks than would have traditionally been the case.  It is therefore no longer acceptable to have a situation where combat personnel and support or service support personnel sit at distant ends of a wide spectrum of individual resilience.  This gap should be narrowed if all SP are to be best prepared for operational service.  This requires moral courage to implement and there is a need for a coherence of approach across Defence and single Service (sS) training establishments to ensure that Robust Training is systematic, progressive and appropriately contextualised."

This Stage of evaluation is challenging in an organisation the size of the MOD. Defence Performance and Risk reporting mechanisms mean it is possible to measure whether training has directly contributed to Defence outputs by measuring performance against the Defence Board Defence Tasks which are, essentially, Defence\u2019s organisational goals. To evaluate business benefits to the organisation, training should be linked to the Defence Tasks and their subordinate SC objectives. Those conducting Stage 4 Evaluation should bear in mind that there are many other factors external to training which may impact business performance (such as redundancy programmes, leadership in the workplace etc). JSP 507 provides guidance on the evaluation of projects including the assessment of whether VfM was achieved."

The reason for this caution whilst undertaking data collection is not only for the interviewee\u2019s benefit but also for the interviewer\u2019s.

In some cases this may be the only data gathering method available or needed. It produces quick results, but the problem with experts is that they tend to overlook routine aspects of a Role that could present problems to the non- expert. This method can also be used to analyse findings (e.g. from questionnaires)."

If the analyst requires some particular detail, but considers that the respondent may not realise why it is required, the analyst must explain the reason behind asking for the information. Increasing the degree of openness of the potential response received can be achieved by offering anonymity (discussed earlier) by not including clearly attributable details in the personal details.

What is necessary is the grouping of answers under suitable headings, so that the completed schedule will indicate clearly and concisely what the interviewee may have taken a quarter of an hour to say. It is then appropriate for the interviewer to indicate how the answer has been recorded (e.g. \u201cAm I right in putting you down as saying?\u201d). This gives the respondent time to think again and for the interviewer to check that what has been said has really been understood. If the answer does not fit under an already accepted heading then it must be inserted under a new heading, which will in turn be available for all subsequent interviews. A pocket-dictating machine may be useful but permission must be gained to use one. Recording interviews can also inhibit interviewees."
