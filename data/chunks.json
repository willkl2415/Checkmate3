    "section": "Purpose and Application.  The purpose of Robust Training is to progressively develop a Service Person’s (SPs) resilience to enable them to perform effectively in any operational environment.  The degree to which Robust Training is employed within an Initial training programme should reflect the employment of that SP in both specialist and generic tasks.  Emphasis should be placed upon the need for SP to perform in the most demanding conditions in which they may realistically expect to find themselves if deployed to high-tempo and/or high-threat operational environments.  As Defence transitions to a contingent posture, the non-linear nature of the Contemporary Operating Environment (COE) will inevitably expose SP from support functions to higher risks than would have traditionally been the case.  It is therefore no longer acceptable to have a situation where combat personnel and support or service support personnel sit at distant ends of a wide spectrum of individual resilience.  This gap should be narrowed if all SP are to be best prepared for operational service.  This requires moral courage to implement and there is a need for a coherence of approach across Defence and single Service (sS) training establishments to ensure that Robust Training is systematic, progressive and appropriately contextualised.",

It is necessary to replicate the physical and mental pressures of operations that are specific to Service and role, noting the need to ensure that supporting personnel should also build resilience through Robust Training.  If all SP are to be best prepared for operational service, training needs to focus on the increased resilience end of the spectrum and where possible enhance the psychological stressors in training (e.g. increased use of battle simulation, additional night training scenarios) and the physical stressors (e.g. extending training days, more time living ‘in the field’ or austere simulated operational conditions)."

It must be proportionate to the delivery of the defined operational output.

These factors are not mutually opposing or irreconcilable.  Robust Training can be delivered during all phases of training whilst successfully discharging Defence’s welfare and Duty of Care responsibilities.  The risks associated with Robust Training must be identified, assessed and addressed with a view to enabling this important element of training.  A culture of risk aversion must be avoided as it merely transfers risk to the Commands and is morally unjustifiable.  It is incumbent upon Commanders, their staff and trainers to be conversant with the principles and application of risk assessment at their respective levels of training command.  Intelligent risk management must be led by the Commander and understood by all staff involved in training delivery.  The first step in developing risk management locally will be through the CRA/SCD process.  Detailed briefing on local procedures must be included in staff/trainer induction training and understanding must be developed further through regular study periods"
