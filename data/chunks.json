    "section": "Context",
    "content": "The full potential of any capability can only be realised with sufficient suitably trained and qualified personnel to operate and sustain it. Therefore, training is a fundamental pillar of the Royal Navy’s Operational Capability. Further, addressing training requirements of new or updated capabilities early with acquisition often results in decreased through-life costs, improved equipment availability, improved safety, and higher morale amongst those with the skills to undertake their role(s). It is the Project Team’s (PT) delegated responsibility to fund, plan, integrate and support the through-life training requirements of any upgraded or new capability as part of the wider support solutions envelope (SSE). Early engagement with the customer through the RN Capability area and Training authorities can help mitigate the risks of unnecessary or significant delay and cost borne from not properly considering the training requirement. The RN provides support, governance and assurance activities to enable the PT to successfully deliver these requirements through the Future Training (FT) and Maritime Acquisition & Training Organisation (MTAO). The MTAO is also able to provide qualified and experienced support for Training Steering Group (TSG) meetings, discussions with Training Needs Analysis (TNA) and Training Solution suppliers, and the QA of deliverables."

    "content": "Defence doctrine defines the PLOD as the provision of sufficient, capable personnel (‘capable’ requires Individual Training (IT) solutions). The Training Line of Development (TLOD) is the rehearsal of military capability and therefore the need for a Team and Collective Training (CT) capability. Within the RN, the PLOD and therefore IT is owned by Director Personnel and Training (Dir P&T) and the TLOD and therefore CT is owned by Director Force Generation (Dir FGEN) as the Training Requirements Authority (TRA) and Commander Fleet Operational Standards and Training (COMFOST) as Training Delivery Authority (TDA), different parts of the organisation with separate management plans and funding lines. The MTAO works for Dir P&T and is charged with assuring the IT aspects of the PLOD, but can signpost PTs to suitable points of contact (PoC) within Dir FGEN and COMFOST’s organisation for TLOD aspects. Although Individual, Team and Collective training are closely linked, and some team elements of training can be covered within IT analysis, design or delivery processes, the delivery structures and governance of Team and CT (the TLOD) differs to those for IT (PLOD). For simplicity, and since a PT is responsible for delivering both IT and CT requirements, both will be referred to as training for the remainder of the document."

The Financial Operating Model (FOM) is designed to strengthen the link between managing Defence’s finances and delivering military capability. It operates within the restrictions of Defence and follows the direction set out in the DOM. The aim is for military capability to be planned, resourced and delivered across all the DLODs and for balance of investment decisions to be taken which create the best Defence outputs from the resources available. Capability comprises eight DLODs as well as the overarching theme of ‘Interoperability’, any of which may give rise to a new training requirement, as could the operating environment, the nature of the threat it will face, and how it will contribute to any larger coalition. Under the   (TLCM) philosophy, all elements that comprise capability must be adequately planned, delivered and generated through-life. Figure 3: Relationship between Capability and DLODs FINMILCAP and  FINMILCAP and TLCM should ensure that the requirements of Defence policy be translated into an approved programme that delivers the required capabilities, through-life, across all DLODs. It is therefore critical that Training is planned, delivered and generated in a manner that is consistent with all other DLODs to ensure provision of a coherent capability through-life. As Training can prove to be one of the most expensive through-life elements, potentially accounting for more than 30% of the whole life costs (WLC) of a project; the organisation introducing a new capability must have a firm appreciation of all known training factors which could threaten project affordability."

Key to success of delivering Training in maritime acquisition is the intelligent application DSAT, explained in detail in Joint Service Publication (JSP) 822. When applied correctly, DSAT should deliver training that is safe, risk-focussed, appropriate, effective, efficient and accountable training to trainees. There are several key roles which are relevant for Training, in particular the TRA and the TDA. The DSAT process comprises four elements, plus management and governance activities that govern all Defence training, both IT and CT, across the Whole Force (Figure 3).

The analysis should be conducted to meet the PT milestones such as to inform the business / operational case for wider resource and risk commitments, such as: awarding an equipment commercial contract, implementing significant doctrinal change, relocating a training establishment (TE), or changing an organisation’s structure.

Where a prime contractor has insufficient training expertise (or if the procurement is commercial-off-the-shelf and the prime contractor offers only a standard training programme) it may be sub-contracted to a commercial provider. In order for the TNA to be undertaken by the prime or its sub-contractor, the overarching contract must have sufficient detail in the URD, SRD and contract to specify the TNA requirement. The PT contracts a commercial provider to undertake the TNA(s) via a suitable commercial framework such as the Managed Learning Service (MLS).

The QA of the TNA is not just a checklist of the content by using quality criteria, as this only involves assessment of the reliability: it must also consider the validity aspects of the relevant subject matter expert input to the final recommendation. Only the combination of quality criteria, validity of source data and objective management will assure that the overall process is “fit for purpose”.

Firstly it should evaluate the TNA methodology through the process of CI, secondly it should evaluate the recommendation by reviewing the training solution it proposed. The rationale for this is that it may be some time (years) after the final report is endorsed before we are in a position to evaluate the proposed solution.” It then provides key Lessons Identified (LIs) and increased levels of confidence in resource and risk forecast information that can be applied to future / ongoing projects, thus continuously improving the whole Analysis and DSAT approach."

    "section": "Purpose",
    "content": "The Defence Systems Approach to Training (DSAT) is “is cyclical and flexible and should  be applied intelligently rather than followed dogmatically. Users should select both the activities  specific to their need and the order in which they are applied, to achieve the most appropriate  Training System.” A variety of providers, both internal and external to Defence, supply Training Needs Analysis (TNA) to support Maritime Acquisition projects and programmes. The contexts and structures of pre-existing Training Systems across each capability domain (Air/Land/Maritime) can differ significantly. To ensure intelligent application of the DSAT in Maritime Acquisition and to maximise the chances of successfully introducing a workable Training Solution into the existing Training System, it is important to ensure alignment of expectations between the analyst(s) and the key project/programme stakeholders. This document therefore provides standards which are intended to normalise TNA practice for analysts working in the Maritime domain and are applicable to both internal and external analysts conducting this work. The DSAT is applicable to all training and development activities within the Defence Training System and is therefore necessarily generic and gives options and freedoms in places; this document is deliberately more specific."

Outsourcing the provision of DSAT activity to commercial organisations can  be an effective use of resources especially where capability or capacity shortfalls exist  and where time imperatives or the need for concurrency demand it. (p.8) This document is designed to be consistent with the DSAT and to complement Maritime domain contracts for outsourced TNA: the contract will detail what is required to be delivered, whilst this document provides product standards and process standards against which the contracted analysis outputs will be assessed.

The identification of primary and secondary impacts on each role in the target audience is an important factor in decisions concerning where RA activity is focused.

Early setup and consultation with the TGS and its key stakeholder members including TNA QA and TRA will allow the optimum approach to be identified and endorsed. SME/Stakeholder. An SME is an individual who has thorough knowledge of a job, function/tasks, or a particular topic, which qualifies them to assist in the TNA process. Identification and availability. It is important to identify key personnel who can provide SME support to the TNA process. The sponsor must be made clearly aware and agree to provide the necessary SMEs. Those nominated should be made aware of the expectations of that dedicated support. SME support can be drawn from a variety of sources including: Operational Command (end user); policy; organisational headquarters; equipment manufacturer; users of the equipment/system; training staff; training equipment companies; CBT designers. In most cases SMEs are not exclusively tasked to provide advice and support. When collecting data and validating analysis the analyst should consider time, location, and the accessibility of SMEs to make the most efficient use of these valuable resources. Workshops, meetings, e-mails and telephone conversations form the normal correspondence. The selection of SMEs may vary during the different phases of the TNA."

Assumptions and Constraints.\tAssumptions and constraints could arise from a variety of factors, including policy, legal requirements, career structures, infrastructure, existing training capability, acquisition decisions, MDAL assumptions, URD and SRD requirements, CONEMP/CONUSE /CONOPS guidance, etc. Analysts should also identify potential constraints to what cannot be achieved in certain methods of training, which may eventually inform a RTGS, e.g. firing of live weapons against enemy targets, excessive violence by/against trainees, environmental legislation, duty of care regulations, full sensory immersion, health and safety legislation, availability of assets, financial cost, political sensitivities, host nation support for training exercises, etc. Both assumptions and constraints may apply to the actual conduct of the Analysis and the training solution recommendation.. It is important that the SE analyst identifies these two types, and ensures that the formers’ impact on the latter is managed effectively. Project assumptions and constraints must be captured and provided for endorsement in the SE report(s).

Analysts should consider the following performance criteria: What is the nature of the performance expectations of individuals and teams involved with the delivery of the capability? Who may need to be trained; individuals, sub-teams, teams and collective?"

Conditions statements are often written in terms of what will be ‘given’ (available to) or ‘denied’ (not available to) the service member while performing the required task and in what environment the task will be performed. Conditions should reflect the work situation as accurately as possible, but include only those factors that influence job performance: An exhaustive list of every trivial condition is not necessary and detracts from the value of the RPS. Conditions that do not impact on Task or Sub-Task performance do not require statements. Since the Conditions may be critical in determining future Training Gaps, informing training design and helping to justify resources, they should be documented as accurately and closely as possible to the actual conditions in the workplace. Each Task and Sub-Task must therefore have a full Conditions statement clearly linked to its Performance statement (not a key to a list of Conditions located elsewhere). It is recognised that Sub-Tasks will usually (although not always) share identical Conditions to their parent Task. In such cases it is not necessary to repeat the full Conditions statement; instead, having checked and confirmed the commonality, a positive statement linking to the Conditions of the parent Task may be made (i.e. for Sub Task 1.3.1: “Conditions as per Task 1.3”)."

Stating “in accordance with JSP 440” therefore gives the next user an unacceptable burden to trace the detail of the Standard. As a baseline expectation, the relevant Publication, Volume/Part and Chapter(s) should normally be specified in every Standard. Publications referenced within Standards should be chosen to avoid variability: i.e. ‘in accordance with Unit Standing Orders’ leaves open the possibility of variation between Standing Orders of different units, and therefore should be avoided."

It then becomes necessary to conduct a comparison between the newly generated Role PS and any extant documentation (OPS/RPS). This process is conducted to enable the analyst to select new or amended Tasks to take forward to develop into TOs in the TGA, and to delete obsolete Tasks and any material that supports them (which will have an effect on any existing TO’s that are taken forward into the new training documentation). The first step in this process is to identify Tasks which are no longer required from the old documentation and ensure that the training conducted to support them is removed from the dependant training documentation. The second step is to identify any tasks that do not alter. This should be done by comparing the Performance Statements as well as the Conditions and Standards for each one. Only when all three remain unchanged can a Task be pulled straight through to the new documentation along with any extant training that supports it. Finally, all tasks that are either new or amended should be carried through to the TGA to have KSA analysis conducted on them in order to develop TOs (also in the form of Performance, Conditions and Standards)"

Good practice in writing Task Performance statements is equally applicable to writing TO Performance statements. It may be feasible and useful to replicate the Performance Statement from the Task when this is what will actually be performed in training; however it may be necessary in some cases to break a Task Performance statement down in to a set of constituent training objective Performance statements. As a result the number of TOs generated would usually be expected to be equal to or greater than the number of Tasks in scope. TO Performance Statements should never be written at a less precise level than the Task they relate to as significant details from the Task will be lost. ‘Reverse engineering’ of TOs from existing or desired training content is never acceptable."

    "content": "The MOTE seeks to derive an objective measure of a training medium’s effectiveness in satisfying a set of training requirements. It is fundamental that this is a direct measure of effectiveness for each task rather than a calculated score derived from weighted combinations of a number of component factors. Collecting scores from a panel of suitable Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) significantly reduces subjectivity in the MOTE. SMEs should be accepted as such by the Training Steering Group to ensure the validity of any assessment. The SMEs involved in the TOA form a MOTE assessment panel that reports to, and is accountable to, the Training Steering Group. It is stressed that authority still rests with the Training Steering Group who will ultimately be responsible for judging the accuracy and validity of the analysis. Where in this Annex the term ‘Option’ is found, it is important that the analyst is aware that an ‘Option’ consists not solely of one media or method, but of a suite of media and methods. It is essential that a single media is not discarded simply because it performs poorly when its effectiveness is judged in a stand-alone mode. The media discarded may well be the most effective for certain training requirements without off-setting the cost parameters too much. This media, when combined with another at little cost, may well prove to be the most cost effective solution available."

Any Group for which the range is greater than 0.2 should be discussed and a record made of the reason for the divergence. Where the alignment meeting highlights misunderstandings or misapplications of the marking guidelines, the individual’s score may be amended. For example, the option scored above might be genuinely effective but scorer 1 did not realise that the option could actually address the shortcomings which caused an assessment of 0.7 to be given at 1.2. Compliance. Each average score is compared with the threshold for compliance to determine whether the option is compliant for that Group. The boundary for compliance is typically 0.8 – just effective. However, in some cases a shortfall might be acceptable in which case the threshold could be lowered. Should RPS complexity or TNA auditability demand, subjectivity in assigning an overall effectiveness score to each Group/option pair can be further reduced by sourcing each individual component score through a weights and measures approach, based on the criteria in Table 1. With this approach the reasoning behind each individual score can be made clearer, together with an indication of where the scorer has place priorities. Each TOA needs to be assessed against its own specific criteria, but an example of this approach can be seen in Table 4. The determination of an overall effectiveness score can be of particular use in creating a detailed audit trail of the thought processes involved in each TOA."

The method identified below gives an auditable and sufficiently objective means of discriminating between training options. This must be tempered with a critical analysis of the outcome of the CBA. For each option the through life costs must be calculated on a consistent approach between media. If absolute costs are not available then the costs must be derived by identical means for each option. In most cases the costs will be based on additional Through Life Costs (TLC) comprising both capital and running costs. Typically, capital costs should include new building, training equipment/GFE (including installation), extra computer hardware/software, courseware development and new training aids. This figure is normally a one off initial payment but there may be periodic renewable elements across the TLC. Annual running/support costs should include instructional and support staff, maintenance, overheads etc. One way of producing this figure might be to obtain the trainee day cost for a particular course; this can be multiplied by the additional course length and annual throughput to give a broad order annual support costs. It should be noted that some options might cause savings that can be offset against TLC; these should be incorporated in the figures. Further detailed guidance can be found in JSP 507 - MOD Guide to Investment Appraisal and Evaluation."

The MOTE and CBA figures are there for guidance purposes, the analysts should consider each option’s score carefully before rejecting or ranking the options. It should be noted that other influences might affect the ranking of options. Care should be taken when discriminating between options to compare on a like for like basis. Typically we might have two approaches; either to compare on level effectiveness or to compare on level cost. In the case at Fig. 5 we might reject option B in favour of option C on the basis that their costs are broadly similar but C is more effective. A consistent model should be applied to compare options. In the case above (Fig 5) options A and B might be rejected as under compliant. This should not be done without consideration of how these options could be brought to compliance. In the case above the cost of making A compliant might be less than selecting option C."

    "section": "Interpretation of the MOTE/CBA Data",
    "content": "In most cases the solution for reaching compliance might include some form of OJT, therefore careful consideration should be given to the calculation of these costs. Several approaches of costing the impact of OJT might be used: OJT could be counted in terms of the cost of providing the OC, for example the cost of 3 days OJT for Command Team Training might be assessed as 3 days of running costs for the particular platform. The cost of OJT might be calculated in terms of interruption to ship’s activities multiplied by capitation rates of those involved. Another strategy might be to calculate the cost of “contracting out” the activity while the personnel are being trained. Whatever the approach, thought should be given to the particular problem and whatever method used must be acceptable to the Steering Group. In some cases the options considered might be variants of a single option. In such cases consideration of raising option effectiveness might be inappropriate as another option might be an enhanced version of the under compliant option."

Certain tasks might be deemed critical in which case an option which was otherwise compliant (MOTE ≥ 0.8) might be rejected as it was deficient in these areas and similarly the converse might apply.

    "content": "Governance of individual training is the process through which decisions are made that determine the long-term strategy, direction and organisation of individual training across Defence. Individual Training Governance provides the framework through which training stakeholders are accountable for continuously improving the quality of their provision to meet Defence requirements. Governance of individual training is managed primarily through boards such as Customer Executive Board(s), Working Groups and Steering Groups. In Defence, individual training is conducted in a variety of single Service, Joint, and Defence training settings. The principles for the governance of Joint, Defence and single Services training requirements are the same. However, because of the additional complexities of Joint and Defence Training, there are differences when it comes to the structures and roles involved in the governance. Although JSP 822 does mandate specific governance activities for all training across, TLBs do retain significant levels of autonomy on the governance of individual training, that falls under their command. It is therefore essential that users of this DTSM also consult local policy documents that may exist, and are managed locally by training policy teams within the TLBs."

    "content": "An Individual Training governance structure refers to the framework and system of rules, roles, responsibilities, and processes that a Defence organisation puts in place to ensure that the development, delivery, assurance and management of individual training remains on track, and appropriate to the organisation’s requirements. Within Defence, an Individual Training governance structures usually takes the form of the traditional hierarchical structure, which is commonly found in other areas of Defence, and most large organisations. A hierarchical governance structure is a type of organisational structure in which authority and decision-making are organised in a top-down fashion, with a clear chain of command and defined levels of management. In this structure, individuals and teams at each level have specific roles, responsibilities, and decision making powers, and they report to higher levels of management."

    "content": "To ensure effective governance of individual training, various groups or committees are established. The specific groups involved in governance can vary widely depending on the training to be governed, size of the organisation, and the governance structures. This chapter only lists the groups that are common across the whole of Defence, in reality there may be many different groups involved with governance of training, and some of these are unique to specific TLBs. It is therefore essential that users of this DTSM also consult local policy documents that may exist, to establish specific governance roles within their TLB."

The TDA will also be best placed to provide the necessary training data. Additionally, the TDA also usually holds the budget for the training. However, the TRA (or Lead TRA) plays a vital role and is the individual/organisation responsible for escalating any risks and issues unresolved at the CEB up the Chain of Command, and for ensuring that appropriate governance and assurance activities are being undertaken. For certain CEBs (e.g. where there are several TDAs, or where the TRA controls the resources, or where the TDA is a contractor), the TRA may decide that it is more appropriate for them to chair the CEB. Chairship should be clearly articulated in the ToRs. The TRA must ensure that a CEB is normally held biannually and both TRA and TDA should attend the CEBs2. Where there are matters that cannot be resolved as part of the CEB (e.g. a TRA believes the requirement is not being met or a TDA does not have the resource to deliver a requirement), these are to be escalated to a higher level within the relevant Chain of Command/TLB for resolution.

    "content": "1.\tThis Section of the Guidance outlines the Defence approach that allows training specialists to adopt a structured, methodical approach to the analysis of the training need, or requirement. It sets out the various activities, collectively termed the TNA, which may be used in order to conduct a TNA, which informs subsequent Elements and forms part of the overall Training System. Overview of the TNA A TNA is a structured analysis of training need arising as a result of new equipment acquisition, doctrinal change, organisational change, or changes to policy/legislation. It generally includes an analysis of different training Methods and technologies, with a view to recommending the optimum training solution which balances cost and quality. It is a highly flexible procedure with the choice of supporting tools and techniques to suit different Training Systems. In all cases, however, a TNA is an output based, iterative process that provides an audit trail for all decisions and is closely mapped to the requirements of the QMS. A TNA does not, and should not, imply that training will be the only solution. If training is not the solution, this will become apparent in the Scoping Exercise, after which, analysis activity will cease."

The key output is an assessment of how well the TNA outputs contributed to the provision of a training solution that meets the Defence requirement. This completes the TNA process. TNE is covered in DTSM 5. Why or when should a TNA be conducted? Before a TNA can begin, a clear evidence-based Statement of Requirement (SoR) is to be produced, preferably in a written format (letter, e-mail, request form or tasking order, for example). Then, prior to the commencement of the analysis, a scoping exercise is conducted which may identify that the most cost-effective means of achieving the required Defence need, is a training solution2. Once the requirement for training has been established, a TNA should be undertaken to ascertain the type and scope of the training requirement that meets the Defence need.

    "content": "Non-training specialist involvement in a TNA. Stakeholders often have a limited knowledge of the MTS and are unfamiliar with the TNA process. At the start of a TNA, time is often well spent in educating those who are to be involved in the TNA about the process. They should be aware of their responsibilities, including the provision of information and staffing routines. Whilst it is not usually the TNA author’s responsibility to the implement the training solution, post TNA, it is possible that they may be involved in subsequent working groups, to provide training support advice. Exploiting existing training activities. The need to design training from scratch on a ‘blank sheet of paper’ is a very unusual occurrence, as it is much more likely that existing training can be modified. It follows, therefore that it is often desirable to analyse the current training first. Where current role information, Role PS / Framework(s) or TOs do not exist for any current training, more comprehensive RA may be required, before any determination of a training requirement can be made. Analysis of similar, existing, training is also useful to support this. Audit trail. A TNA should generate a clear audit trail which plots the sequence of events and decisions leading to a training solution. The justification and supporting evidence used as the basis for these decisions should be readily apparent (such as: references to, and/or copies of, academic research literature; the deliberations of the Analysts; minutes of TNASG meetings and Defence/Contractor publications). A quality audit trail requires full disclosure of, and rationale for, the methodology, tools and data sources used in the analysis, with copies of any specialist or bespoke software made available to the TNASG."

    "content": "Iterative/selective nature of TNAs. Whilst a TNA is carried out by completing a number of activities in sequence, it is important to note that the process is iterative in nature. Many influencing factors, risks and assumptions are liable to change during the conduct of a TNA. It is therefore important that at every stage of a TNA, the key outputs are reviewed to ensure their continuing validity, and that stages of the process be repeated if necessary. Processes for reviewing the TNA outputs should be capable of amendment where changes are required. Tight control should be exercised by the TNASG, which approves all changes to the TNA. Follow-on changes to the training requirement and the impact on training may be managed through a system of configuration control but this does not remove the responsibility of the TNASG for ensuring that changes are reflected in the TNA. It should be noted that the cheapest option is not necessarily the most cost-effective option in meeting the training requirement. Also, the cheapest option is not necessarily to continue existing training within existing resources. Therefore, ‘effectiveness’ is the key as it is the extent to which the training has prepared the individual for the Defence effect which matters. Cost is ‘efficiency’ focused to optimise the use of resources to enable the execution of training (and required learning) and ensure Value for Money (VfM)."

    "content": "The scoping exercise involves the initial analysis of the requirement and, where applicable, suggested options for meeting the requirement including a broad order estimate of the resource implications associated with each option. This is articulated in the Scoping Exercise Report. The scoping exercise should be completed as early as possible and starts by acquiring as much relevant information as possible about the training need and the Customer requirement. It defines the TNA management, risk, programming and resourcing within the boundaries of policy, assumptions and constraints. It also highlights issues that impact upon, or will need to be considered, during Stage 2. It will advise the TNA strategy for the proposed training solution and provide the parameters of the new or changed Defence requirement where TNAs will be, or have been, carried out. The scoping exercise does not have to be a long and protracted document and can utilise electronic references such as minutes of meetings, records of conversations to provide an auditable trail. Provided that a training need is confirmed then a search of existing training activities across Defence, including the DLE, is to be conducted to ascertain if training, already designed, could satisfy, or partly satisfy, the need. The scoping exercise should then outline the aim, constraint, assumptions, proposed methodology and timescales, and provide an estimate of the resources required for the subsequent analysis and design stages. The scoping exercise is the initial investigation and should derive a strategy and tentative solution for meeting the need for a training intervention. As this investigation progresses, decisions about how to apply the DSAT process should be made. For example, is it necessary to complete a full Role Analysis (RA) from first principles, or is it sufficient to confirm that an existing Role PS / Framework is still valid? Likewise, the strategy may recommend the process focuses on certain elements of a Role/task Performance which need further development or perhaps recommends targeting the TOs to ensure they support a Role PS and/or Framework. It may be decided that the sequence of training be reviewed if this is highlighted as a potential problem or that further consideration is given to current refresher training intervals. The scoping exercise should also cover a list of the resources required to complete the subsequent activities and an agreement as to which organisation(s) will provide them."

In the course of analysing a particular role, it is often the case that to carry out the role effectively, an individual should possess certain characteristics. If this is so, then it is important to determine an appropriate balance between selection and training in order to provide people who have these characteristics and who are, therefore, capable of doing the role. The training audience is the group of learners for whom the training requirement is intended. The purpose of this description is to identify the: training audience groupings, the number and type of groups that need to be addressed (e.g. operator, maintainer, manager, train-the-trainer; individual, team, unit etc)."

The TNA may be directed to examine a particular potential training solution, however, without prejudicing the final outcome. Constraints may also be identified in strategic trends, doctrine, concept documents (e.g. the Concept of Employment for a capability) or can be determined through contextual analysis (such as via PESTLE7 or other frameworks). They should also involve consideration of all the Defence Lines of Development (DLoDs)8. Key constraints include: Policy. On occasion, Defence Policy will dictate the Methods and Media to be used. The TNA should adhere to the DTEL Rules9 and Defence Policy for Modelling & Simulation (M&S) (), as well as taking account of policies on the use of the  10 and Human Factors Integration for Defence Systems ().

It is built up gradually by repeated correct training or practice. At Initial KSA analysis, the skills listed are kept quite high level. Later on in the Design process the split into mental and physical/practical skills can be further refined: Mental skills. These constitute the knowing how (procedural knowledge) as opposed to the knowing what (facts) (e.g. knowing how to calculate percentages, knowing how to interpret technical data, knowing how to classify sonar contacts). It would not be possible for the trainee to learn all of these things as facts because too many individual instances exist. The mental skills the trainee learns, therefore, enable them to respond to entire classes of situations, e.g. to make decisions when presented with information and alternative courses of action. Physical/practical skills. These can be described as learned capabilities of performing actions in an organised and fluid manner. They are overt and observable during their performance. Skills may be discrete (operate a switch) or continuous (fly/drive a vehicle). These skills are learned in connection with common activities such as using a computer, driving a car or playing a musical instrument. Many tasks performed in Defence can be categorised as having a large physical component, e.g. stripping and assembling a weapon (discrete), flying an aircraft (continuous) and tying a bowline (discrete). Complex physical skills can often be broken down into smaller sub-skills, which can be learned separately and then put together for total performance. An example of this is swimming, which has 3 sub-skills (arm action, leg action and breathing technique), which can be learned and practised separately and then performed as one. More complex skills such as flying/driving, are similarly broken down into their component parts and taught as discrete skills in discrete lessons."

    "content": "Attitudes. An Attitude is a way of thinking and feeling about something, often but not always demonstrated through behaviour. The identification of Standards relating to personal qualities and Attitudes is perhaps the most challenging part of the KSA Analysis. This is because Attitudes cannot always be observed directly and hence the creation of definable standards can prove difficult. Attitude is defined as a predisposition resulting in a tendency to act or react in a certain manner when confronted with another person, group, object, situation or idea. It is important to understand that this predisposition to think and feel in a certain way does not necessarily result in observable behaviours. An example of this could be an individual who holds an Attitude that all dogs are dangerous. However, this attitude may not be obvious to others when the individual is handling a dog with which they are familiar and have learned is friendly. Table 2 illustrates how Attitudes can manifest themselves. Table 2: Attitudes Within each role there are tasks that have an attitudinal component related to their performance. Initial KSA Analysis identifies Attitudes associated with role performance to determine the required direction of that attitude. At this stage the Analysis of Attitude can"

Once the Attitudes required to fulfil a Role are identified, training can be designed to achieve them. Knowledge and skill training can be wasted if attitudinal training is ignored. A lecture on computer security may be successful in imparting information on how viruses are transmitted but unless it develops an attitude of security consciousness the trainees may not use the knowledge they have gained on the subject. To assess an attitude, behaviour must be observed, possibly over a period of time. To assist subjective judgements on attitude an objective criteria should, where possible, be used to support the decision. Defining the negative, what is unacceptable behaviour, can result in a simpler and more precise Standard. A Behaviourally Anchored Rating Scale (BARS) is an example of a tool which can be used to assess observable behaviour objectively. Although a BARS (Table 3) can be used to measure attitude indirectly through observing behaviour, much care is needed when inferring Attitudes from observable behaviours alone. Attitudes may also be directly measured using validated questionnaires or other psychometric instruments21. Some examples are presented in Table 3. Note that whilst BARS is predominantly a tool used in the training environment, forming part of the ASpec if appropriate, it is mentioned here because it is useful to bear it in mind at the RA stage.

It is, however, important to understand both the people and training aspects, as different methodologies of analysis fit different needs, and, within the Defence context, they are sometimes confused. The relationship between competency, competence and performance needs to be understood in a consistent manner: Competency (plural: competencies) is the underlying characteristic(s) of an individual which results in effective and/or superior performance within a Role. OJAR/SJAR is an example of an organisational level competency framework that is common to all Service personnel. Professional competency frameworks can also be used in order to provide guidance to defined professional groups, such as the Royal Navy’s Command Competency Framework, where there is a need for longer term individual professional development and/or selection."

Selection, development (including education) and training have key roles in growing necessary competencies and competences. Therefore, effective human capability development should not neglect either; instead, consideration of both will result in optimal requirement setting and solution development. Competence development (in the form of a Role PS and associated training solutions) is covered under the DSAT training analysis process contained within this policy. Furthermore, DSAT derived training solutions may either require some competencies as a pre-requisite or be developed during a training solution (often at the EO level). Competence Frameworks Competence frameworks are not the sole preserve of Defence and many external bodies and organisations utilise and develop them. Where an external awarding body has already developed an appropriate competence framework (usually in the form of job-related standards/qualifications grouped under competence areas) it is acceptable within the DSAT process to utilise this, as appropriate, rather than developing bespoke a Role PS from scratch. This has the added benefit of easing the accreditation process and aiding skills transfer from both within Defence and externally (particularly during transition to civilian life). Furthermore, where similar competences are employed over a wide range of roles across Defence (e.g. more than one TLB), it may be appropriate to develop a competence"

The use of an established competence framework does not absolve the analyst from capturing both the requirement and solution within the TrAD along with the necessary documentation; ensuring it is endorsed by the CEB.

Competency Frameworks Similarly, competency frameworks are also used outside of Defence as they are recognised to have applications across a whole range of developmental activities, including training. Competency frameworks are now seen as an essential vehicle for achieving organisational performance through the development of ‘human capital’ by reviewing individual capability and potential. Essentially, competency frameworks are a human resource tool and are generally used at organisational or functional level and can be used in selection, performance development and training. Competency frameworks are used to document required organisational behaviours, under grouped competency areas; such as Leadership, Communication, Problem-solving and Team-working. Where competency frameworks exist, it is acceptable to use them within DSAT, if the behavioural descriptors are appropriate within the context of Defence."

They help ensure that the associated trainers, support staff and trainees have a clear understanding of what the trainees are required to learn and to be able to do at the end of the lesson/learning event. TOs form the basis of the detailed design of each of the training lessons as well as identification of appropriate training resources. They may also be used in support of the award of civilian accreditation. Therefore, the development and maintenance of accurate TOs is essential. TOs are drafted during Element 1 and then these draft TOs should be further refined and developed during Element 2 (Design). TOs are precise statements of what tasks a trainee should be able to do, post training, in the Role that the training was designed to prepare them for. A TO is measurable and has three constituents: the Performance required, the Conditions under which the trainee must perform, and the Standard to which the trainee must perform. These statements should be in the form of observable and measurable behaviours which allow the achievement of the TOs to be confirmed through assessment. A TO defines what a successful trainee is able to do at the end of a period of training, i.e. the learning outcome25. It does not describe the learning process or any learning experience. TOs should be derived from the respective Role PS / Framework(s). The determination of TOs is a skilled process and the product must accurately reflect the needs of the Role. The production of TOs may be an iterative process and should be reviewed at each stage of the design process."

The identification of Standards relating to personal qualities, attitudes and behaviours is perhaps the most challenging part of TO development. This is because attitudes cannot be observed directly and hence the precision associated with other Standards is rarely possible. For subjective judgements objective criteria should, where possible, be used to support the decision (e.g. what observable behaviour is the key indicator that a trainee has acquired the appropriate Standard?). Defining the negative, what is unacceptable behaviour, can result in a simpler and more precise Standard. TO Tagging and Numbering. TOs should be tagged to identify them as a Core (training) requirement, Legal requirement and/or Accreditation requirement, which is denoted using a letter (C, L, A) or a mark in the relevant column on the training statements with amplifying comments if appropriate. To ensure that training is allocated to all tasks, the link between tasks and TOs should be shown through an auditable numbering/identification system. This can be achieved by using the task numbers from the Role PS to identify their dependent TOs. An example is at Table 10."

    "content": "The training environment and implications of location for each training solution may well require analysis at this stage. For example, constraints on training resources and the availability of real equipment for training may force the emphasis towards workplace training. The same would be true if it is not possible to replicate critical Role PS Conditions in training establishments or via distributed training. Alternatively expensive and scarce training equipment or qualified trainers may only be available in [some] training establishments. It is therefore important to determine an estimate of where the balance between training to be delivered in a training establishment and workplace training will fall. It is based on a careful analysis of exactly what the TRA requires, tempered by that which is deliverable and can only be achieved by consultation with the TRA and the Training Provider, who will have knowledge of existing training and current training facilities and resources. This will later result in the allocation of TOs to a TPS, WTS, or, where no training will take place, the Performance, Conditions and Standards to a RTGS32. The output from this work could be an amendment to the Initial Training Categories or recommendations that take account of both DIF Analysis results and the impact of all other Role, training and resource factors."

The Method used to deliver training depends on whether learning is categorised as Knowledge, a mental or physical Skill, or an Attitude. Each EO must be examined to determine whether it is primarily expressed as a KSA. This will suggest the appropriate choice of Method (e.g. a Skills-based EO must have some element of practice involved in the Method; whilst role-play is an example of a training Method suitable for a Behaviour-based EO). The aim must be to choose a Method that is compatible with the material to be learned. Learning a physical Skill may require equipment and machinery and a low trainee-to-trainer ratio as it tends to be trainee-centric. Knowledge learning is most effective and efficient via e-learning, in the form of a lecture, or with links to information. This works best in a flipped classroom, where learning is then consolidated through discussion."

    "content": "Retention ability. A basic categorisation of training Methods should state that these can either be trainer or learner centric. The appropriate selection of training Methods improves the effectiveness and efficiency of learning. Wherever possible, a learner-focused approach should be adopted although this is not always as simple as it seems as it can be time consuming and resource heavy. A learner-focused approach aids information retention by considering the needs of the trainees and increasing their involvement in the learning process. A trainer-focused approach, whilst increasing trainee-to-trainer ratios, is not as effective for aiding trainee retention. The more active the trainee is in the learning process, the higher the rate of retention. Learning preferences. Learning takes place when learners reflect on what they have done, or from what others have done. Therefore, it is imperative that for the effective and efficient acquisition of the required KSA, time is built into the programme, to facilitate learning through reflection. People learn from reflecting on their own, or others experience. Therefore, enabling experiential learning is the most effective and efficient way of enabling learning. Trainee characteristics."

Adults are internally motivated and self-directed. Adult learners resist learning when they feel others are imposing information, ideas or actions on them. They prefer to have control over what they learn and when they learn it. Guide (rather than direct) students to foster their internal motivation to learn and move them toward more self- directed and independent learning. Adults bring life experiences and knowledge to learning experiences. Adults like to be given the opportunity to make use of their existing foundation of knowledge and life experience to support their new learning experiences. Identify and acknowledge students’ past experience and use active learning techniques that allow them to problem solve using logical reasoning and common sense."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "content": "Trainers need to provide training in a way that recognises trainees’ life experiences and allows them to take ownership of their own learning2. In this way, they are motivated to learn and become independent and ‘agile’ learners. Learner-centred training means enabling trainees to actively take part in their learning, rather than passively receiving instruction. It means teaching trainees how to think and solve problems by drawing on their past experiences, using common sense and logic to research and evaluate evidence, then reflecting on their findings to reach conclusions. Learner-centred training uses active training techniques and lets trainees learn from each other and from their own mistakes. It promotes deeper learning, which is meaningful and memorable, rather than surface learning which is easily forgotten. It is the most effective and efficient way to provide learning. The DTCF sets out the requirement for “learning events to be learner- centric and structured to the learning process,” in Competency Group 2 and the requirement that “individuals are actively engaged in the learning process” in Competency Group 4. Application of the  (PAR3) model is identified in Competency 2.1 as appropriate for the promotion of active learning. Competency 4.1 identifies the need for trainers to manage both individual and group needs during learning events."

    "content": "The PAR model is chosen by Defence as the easiest to understand and employ. It should be used as the basis for planning and facilitating all lessons. Trainers should reflect regularly on how learner-centred their lessons are and share good practice where a particular learner-centred approach has worked well (or even if it has not). They should also seek feedback from their trainees on which methods and techniques are most effective from their point of view. People learn from reflecting on their experiences, i.e., they do something and reflect on how successful it was, in order to draw conclusions, supporting by the trainer, on what they will do differently next time. Whilst having the experience themselves is preferable, if this is not possible, then the next best option is to consider the experience that somebody else has had, reflect on how successful it was, and draw conclusions, supported by the trainer, on how they will do it differently to be more successful.4"

    "content": "Making training learner-centred also encourages trainees to  their learning, i.e. they monitor their own knowledge and skills and make decisions on how they can progress. Trainees who self-regulate their learning are motivated to learn through-life and are confident of their ability to learn, and so they are more likely to take action to remain competent and current in their job role. Trainers can teach trainees to self-regulate by prompting them to set and reflect on individual goals, using feedback to then identify and review what they did to achieve the goal. Concentrating more on what the trainee did (or did not do), rather than the actual outcome, helps to develop these self-monitoring capabilities. Learning from mistakes is also a very effective tool in self-regulated learning and trainees need to be given the freedom to make mistakes where safety, time and resources permit. The DTCF sets out the requirement for “learning events to meet both organisational and individual goals” in Competency Group 2 and the requirement for trainees to “set realistic personal goals based on self-assessment and constructive feedback” in Competency Group 4. Competency 2.2 requires the trainer to apply the 5 components5 of the self-regulated learning process and Competency 4.2 highlights the importance of goal setting, feedback and learner self-reflection. Trainers should aim to use these basic coaching techniques both when delivering lessons and when working with individual trainees. Self-regulation in learning describes a process of controlling and evaluating one’s own learning6 and behaviour7. This process may be subconscious, but is more effective if a conscious activity. There are four stages17: task perception, goal setting, enacting and adaptation."

Table 2: Active v Passive Learner Trainee motivation is the key factor in adopting self-regulation.

    "content": "Training Objectives (TOs) ensure that the training activity has a definite purpose such that the Defence need is met. They help ensure that the associated trainers, support staff and trainees have a clear understanding of what the trainees are required to learn and to be able to do at the end of the lesson/learning event. TOs form the basis of the detailed design of each of the training lessons or collective training events as well as identification of appropriate training resources. They may also be used in support of the award of civilian accreditation. Therefore, the development and maintenance of accurate TOs is essential. TOs were drafted during Element 1, and these draft TOs should now be further refined and developed during Design Stage 1. TOs are precise statements of what tasks a trainee should be able to do, post training, in the Role and/or team environment that the training was designed to prepare them for. A TO is measurable and has three constituents: the Performance required, the Conditions under which the trainee must perform, and the Standard to which the trainee must perform. These statements should be in the form of observable and measurable behaviours which allow the achievement of the TOs to be confirmed through assessment. A TO defines what a successful trainee is able to do at the end of a period of training, i.e. the learning outcome10. It does not describe the learning process or any learning experience. TOs should be derived from the respective Role PS/Framework. The determination of TOs is a skilled process and the product must accurately reflect the needs of the Role. The production of TOs may be an iterative process and should be reviewed at each stage of the design process."

Regarding the Role PS/Competency Framework/Competence Framework, Standards can either be product Standards (minimum absolute Standards) or process Standards (certain procedures that need to be followed in a particular sequence) or a mixture of the two. Determining the Standard of Performance required for all training environments is difficult. The nature of the Performance (which could be dangerous, critical, or an emergency task), the consequence of not meeting the Standard and/or the training category should be considered. The Standard required will ultimately affect how that Performance is taught and how the trainee is assessed. For example, if a very high Standard is required, the trainee will receive a large amount of training for the Performance (creating the possibility of becoming over-trained) and may be subject to strict assessment, such as no mistakes. The Standard should be accurate. Some Performances may be subject to external rules and regulations, i.e. the Standard is dictated such as13: Health and Safety."

Differences may occur if the Standard cannot be achieved because the Conditions cannot be simulated. Standards in TOs should not be confused with the standards of tests. Whilst test standards should be set as closely as possible to those stated against the TO, there are certain areas where compromise may be necessary when setting test standards. The identification of Standards relating to personal qualities, attitudes and behaviours is perhaps the most challenging part of TO development. This is because attitudes cannot be observed directly and hence the precision associated with other Standards is rarely possible. For subjective judgements objective criteria should, where possible, be used to support the decision (e.g. what observable behaviour is the key indicator that a trainee has acquired the appropriate Standard?). Defining the negative, what is unacceptable behaviour, can result in a simpler and more precise Standard."

Where Conditions and/or Standards are common to a number of EOs, there is no requirement to duplicate the Conditions and Standards elements. In hierarchical terms, an EO is subordinate to a TO. The material required to achieve the EO is further broken down into a number of relevant Key Learning Points (KLPs), derived from the KSA Analysis conducted in Element 1. KLPs state the Knowledge and Skill requirements, as well as the Attitude needs. The KLPs provide a sequenced framework for the development of the training activity and specify a Learning Outcome.

It is, therefore, important that the AStrat is endorsed by the TRA and appropriate governance body (such as the CEB) once the EOs/KLPs have been determined. A carefully conceived AStrat will achieve: A justification for all testing on the basis of the overall assessment that has to be made, such that an individual is qualified to fill a Role or use equipment. In particular, the strategy should explain how the overall grade is determined.

    "section": "Learning factors.",
    "content": "Type of learning. The Method used to deliver training depends on whether learning is categorised as Knowledge, a mental or physical Skill, or an Attitude. Each EO must be examined to determine whether it is primarily expressed as a KSA. This will suggest the appropriate choice of Method (e.g. a Skills-based EO must have some element of practice involved in the Method; whilst role-play is an example of a training Method suitable for a Behaviour-based EO). The aim must be to choose a Method that is compatible with the material to be learned. Learning a physical Skill may require equipment and machinery and a low trainee-to-trainer ratio as it tends to be trainee-centric. Knowledge learning is most effective and efficient via e-learning, in the form of a lecture, or with links to information. This works best in a flipped classroom, where learning is then consolidated through discussion. Retention ability17. A basic categorisation of training Methods should state that these can either be trainer or learner centric. The appropriate selection of training Methods improves the effectiveness and efficiency of learning. Wherever possible, a learner-focused approach should be adopted although this is not always as simple as it seems as it can be time consuming and resource heavy. A learner-focused approach aids information retention by considering the needs of the trainees and increasing their involvement in the learning process. A trainer-focused approach, whilst increasing trainee-to-trainer ratios, is not as effective for aiding trainee retention. The more active the trainee is in the learning process, the higher the rate of retention."

These are evaluated by comparing the training and cost-effectiveness of each option, from which the most suitable solution can be chosen and recommended with supporting justification. Typically it is the Knowledge category of the KSA spectrum which can be handled most flexibly through DLE. The DLE is the primary Virtual Learning Environment for Defence and should be considered in the first instance to facilitate various methods and media as part of a blended approach. Defence Direction for Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) is contained within JSP 822, Volume 6. A particular training Media may appear to be best suited to a particular training activity but can only be adopted as the solution if all resourcing issues (effectiveness, workforce, equipment and facilities etc) combine to produce the most effective, efficient and economic overall through-life package.

    "content": "A key aspect of the Training System is its execution, i.e. the training being delivered to trainees. It is therefore at this stage that the result of the previous Analysis stages and Design stages are brought together to enable the trainer to produce lesson plans, and/or collective training event plans, to ensure effective training wherever it is delivered. This is done through the generation of LSpecs; the main purpose of which is to control the execution of training i.e. what is taught and how it is taught. LSpecs are produced from the outputs from the Design stages covered previously that produce an AStrat and Methods & Media selection. The Defence format for LSpecs is at Annex A. Depending on the nature of training, LSpecs can be succinct or very detailed. They contain the details of the EO and associated KLPs, the relevant assessment/test, Method & Media selected, time allocated and resource requirements and essential references. Thus the lesson, or event, to be delivered and all the information needed by the trainer to deliver training, including the structure and sequence of training, is contained within the LSpec. It covers 2 main areas: administrative details of the course, and the execution parts of the training delivery. There may be more than one execution part if there are a series of lessons, or events, required to achieve a single EO. Administration. This part of the LSpec outlines the administrative details of the training activity."

It should include all essential information on content with reference to the use of any Methods, Media and teaching activity. All the material delivered is based on the TO as well as: EO. Each LSpec should be based on an EO which contributes to the main TO. However, there may be instances where more than one EO is covered within one LSpec (where the material is very closely related) and should therefore be taught as an integrated whole. An LSpec may also cover more than one lesson or event."

An agile force is one whose people learn continuously, from experience and from each other, as well as from training courses.

Whether in the workplace or a training establishment, the underlying principles and standards for the delivery of Defence training remain the same. Training provision is the process conducted by the Training Provider that enables and allows trainees to learn. It is the outputs that ensure trainers are trained, learning activities are piloted, programmed and resourced, learning is prepared for, training deficiencies are managed, risks are assessed and trainees are appropriately cared for."

These are not as easy to measure, but they are important if trainees are to perform to the best of their ability. To ensure that all the desired outcomes are achieved when preparing training, the following principles of training delivery1 should be applied: Trainer as role model, Learner-centred training,"

Adult learners tend to prioritise their learning and so they want to know how the learning relates to their immediate goals. Provide opportunities to make use of (apply) new learning in a lesson in order to help students recognise the relevance and value of what they are learning. Adults learn by reflecting on what they have done, or what others have done. Active participation is important for adults and they generally learn best by starting with a problem, working to find a solution, and reflecting on the outcome in order to draw conclusions about how they will do it differently next time, in order to increase performance. Where possible use realistic tasks, situations and scenarios for problem solving exercises."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "content": "Trainers need to provide training in a way that recognises trainees’ life experiences and allows them to take ownership of their own learning2. In this way, they are motivated to learn and become independent and ‘agile’ learners. Learner-centred training means enabling trainees to actively take part in their learning, rather than passively receiving instruction. It means teaching trainees how to think and solve problems by drawing on their past experiences, using common sense and logic to research and evaluate evidence, then reflecting on their findings to reach conclusions. Learner-centred training uses active training techniques and lets trainees learn from each other and from their own mistakes. It promotes deeper learning, which is meaningful and memorable, rather than surface learning which is easily forgotten. It is the most effective and efficient way to provide learning. The DTCF sets out the requirement for “learning events to be learner- centric and structured to the learning process,” in Competency Group 2 and the requirement that “individuals are actively engaged in the learning process” in Competency Group 4. Application of the  (PAR3) model is identified in Competency 2.1 as appropriate for the promotion of active learning. Competency 4.1 identifies the need for trainers to manage both individual and group needs during learning events."

Trainers should reflect regularly on how learner-centred their lessons are and share good practice where a particular learner-centred approach has worked well (or even if it has not). They should also seek feedback from their trainees on which methods and techniques are most effective from their point of view. People learn from reflecting on their experiences, i.e., they do something and reflect on how successful it was, in order to draw conclusions, supporting by the trainer, on what they will do differently next time. Whilst having the experience themselves is preferable, if this is not possible, then the next best option is to consider the experience that somebody else has had, reflect on how successful it was, and draw conclusions, supported by the trainer,  on  how  they  will  do  it  differently  to  be  more  successful.  4"

    "content": "Making training learner-centred also encourages trainees to  their learning, i.e. they monitor their own knowledge and skills and make decisions on how they can progress. Trainees who self-regulate their learning are motivated to learn through-life and are confident of their ability to learn, and so they are more likely to take action to remain competent and current in their job role. Trainers can teach trainees to self-regulate by prompting them to set and reflect on individual goals, using feedback to then identify and review what they did to achieve the goal. Concentrating more on what the trainee did (or did not do), rather than the actual outcome, helps to develop these self-monitoring capabilities. Learning from mistakes is also a very effective tool in self-regulated learning and trainees need to be given the freedom to make mistakes where safety, time and resources permit. The DTCF sets out the requirement for “learning events to meet both organisational and individual goals” in Competency Group 2 and the requirement for trainees to “set realistic personal goals based on self-assessment and constructive feedback” in Competency Group 4. Competency 2.2 requires the trainer to apply the 5 components5 of the self-regulated learning process and Competency 4.2 highlights the importance of goal setting, feedback and learner self-reflection. Trainers should aim to use these basic coaching techniques both when delivering lessons and when working with individual trainees. Self-regulation in learning describes a process of controlling and evaluating one’s own learning6 and behaviour7. This process may be subconscious, but is more effective if a conscious activity. There are four stages17: task perception, goal setting, enacting and adaptation."

Trainers should always use an up to date ASpec when planning an assessment. The main purpose of the ASpec is to control what is assessed and how. Trainers must assess all of the EOs and KLPs as specified in the ASpec and not make any changes that alter these. The manner in which the assessment is conducted is determined by the ASpec. Designers strive to provide as much realism as possible, sometimes by using simulation, instrumented or scenario-based activities and so unauthorised changes to the realism of a practical assessment may make it invalid. If limited resources make it difficult to deliver the assessment in the recommended way or the ASpec appears too restrictive, the DTS, DTM or Chain of Command should be informed."

A good lesson plan considers all the needs and expectations of the training audience, prepares for any ‘what ifs’ and enables the trainer to feel confident that nothing has been left to chance. Lesson/event plans must be based on the LSpec and take a learner-centric approach. They are created by the trainer using the LSpec and a trainer should request support in developing their Lesson Plan should they need it10. One of the key benefits of planning learning is that it encourages the trainer to think about any potential barriers to learning and to plan how to overcome these. In addition to the information taken from the LSpec, lesson plans may also include information on: Timings. A key part of the skill is in planning timings. Time is at a premium in most training environments and a lesson/event which runs over time, or which fails to deliver all of the planned KLPs in the time allowed is likely to have a significant impact on other parts of the schedule."

Whilst it may not always be possible to choose the best environment in which to conduct training, good planning will ensure that the potential barriers presented by less than perfect surroundings are reduced or removed. Lesson/event plans should contain sufficient information on how the environment will be managed, including the safety brief and risk assessment. Motivation. A lesson/event where motivation has not been considered and planned for is unlikely to be very successful. Good trainers consider their training audience and plan approaches which will motivate trainees, both as individuals and teams. Awareness of possible demotivators is important as is how to remove or avoid them. Table 1 shows examples of both motivators and demotivators that might be relevant to military training whatever the training environment."

Even with full use of TEL and flipped classrooms to minimise lecture time in the classroom, some events in training may still need a more directed delivery approach. This is to be avoided whenever possible not least because it is the learner-centred approach that ultimately helps the trainee to develop confidence and competence. Facilitation of learning means the trainer will relinquish much of the power but none of the overall control. A good trainer should be able to let the trainees direct the pace and content according to their abilities while ensuring that the KLPs are still drawn out. Confirmation of learning outcomes. It is not enough just to deliver the lesson/event according to the LSpec; for training to be effective the trainer also needs to know that learning has actually taken place. It is therefore important to plan not only the activities but the Methods of confirming learning outcomes. This can be achieved by question and answer sessions and observing individual activities or by quizzes, tests or trainee summaries."

    "content": "Whilst the generic guidance above on lesson/event planning is relevant to all training environments, there are some special considerations for training that is undertaken in the workplace. Lesson/event planning for workplace training is just as essential a part of the training delivery process. Depending on the delivery Method to be used, a workplace lesson and/or event plan similar to those used in a more structured training environment may be appropriate. Where TOs are delivered over a longer period of time in-role, the trainer will need to be much more flexible in their approach and the planning process should reflect this. The use of LSpecs and lesson/event plans remains the same. Where workbooks or portfolios are used to stipulate the training to be delivered, planning may focus more on identifying and organising opportunities for learning to take place in the work environment. In this case, the trainer may wish to plan a programme of workplace Tasks that will present the trainee with the opportunity to practise a Skill under supervision, or to learn new Knowledge and Skills through workplace experience. The Standards to be achieved should be clearly stated and the trainer should know the process for assessing and recording completion of the TOs. The workplace environment may be very different from a more structured training environment and will have its own advantages and disadvantages. Potential barriers to workplace learning include: Distractions. Learning in the workplace is a much more informal environment and the trainer may have less control over distractions like background noise and interruptions. While this may create a much more realistic context for the trainee, it may also hamper the delivery of new information and could impact on safety. Good planning will ensure that the risks are properly assessed and, where it is likely that noise or other distractions will impact on learning, the plan should contain information on how this should be managed."

    "content": "In order to ensure that training is analysed, designed, delivered and assured to a set standard, Defence uses the Defence Systems Approach to Training. A great deal of work goes into the design and development of training to make sure that it is relevant, realistic and prepares Defence personnel properly for the jobs they have to do. Well-designed training, however, can still fail if it is not delivered in the way it was intended. Training deliverers must therefore comply with the specifications of the training design when they deliver their lessons. The DTCF sets out the requirement for trainers to employ “relevant DSAT course documentation to identify desired learning outcomes and plan collective learning events” in Competency 2.1 and to adapt “delivery according to trainee response while still achieving planned outcomes” in Competency 4.1. Trainers must ensure the overall objectives or the lesson are met and that the relevant Learning Specifications (LSpecs) and Assessment Specifications (ASpecs) are adhered to. Course documentation (specifically the LSpec, AStrat and ASpec) is the trainer’s crucial link to the DSAT process. It provides the authority to deliver standardised training and forms the basis for the production of course programmes, lesson plans and assessments. Training must be delivered in accordance with the relevant specifications and so if any part of the course documentation is not available for a specific course or lesson, trainers should inform the course manager immediately. Trainers or trainees may highlight issues with training content, for example, pertaining to currency or relevance. In this case, it is important to use the DSAT system correctly to highlight shortcomings. Alterations to Training Objectives (TO), Enabling Objectives (EO) or Key Learning Points (KLPs) within the course documentation can only be achieved by following local course change processes, which must include the Training Delivery Authority. Trainers must be absolutely clear on their boundaries when adjusting lesson content and should be fully briefed on the process for requesting updates or amendments to course documentation."

TEL is a particularly fast-developing area, which now covers a much broader and more complex range of technologies, meaning that there are an increasing number of ways in which technology is being exploited across Defence. Learning technology is currently used to support learning in the classroom, to provide information (for knowledge-based learning) before the classroom activity, to provide training remotely, to provide realism in training and to increase trainee engagement. Trainers must be able to employ common technology in their lessons, and may be required to support trainees using technology in other contexts, e.g. e-tutoring, Computer Aided Instruction (CAI), Computer Based Training (CBT), or use of simulators."

    "content": "Managing risks to the trained output (i.e. the KSA of the trainees undergoing individual training) is different from assessing and managing risks associated with the Training System. The responsibility for the management of training deficiency lies with the Training Provider. Where risks or issues resulting from identified training deficiencies cannot be mitigated by the Training Provider such training deficiency-based risks should be elevated for treatment or toleration etc. Identifying and raising training deficiencies shows the stakeholders where training shortfalls exist or where risks have been taken owing to either an inability to train certain TOs (due to weather constraints or equipment casualties, for example) or a training failure that has been picked up through the assurance process. Such deficiencies suggest that trainees may not hold the competences that the training should have delivered. These are essentially unplanned but unavoidable training gaps which should therefore be captured and the appropriate governance body informed so that a decision can be made to treat, tolerate or transfer11 the training deficiency."

    "content": "Trainee performance is directly related to trainee potential and to any barriers which prevent them from performing effectively. All trainers will be required to work with a mix of trainees who may be affected by one or more of these barriers. Failure to address this can have a significant impact on trainee motivation, performance and retention. Trainers must therefore ensure that everyone has the same opportunity to learn, develop and succeed. That means preventing barriers from arising where possible and helping individuals to deal with barriers when they do arise. This is known as inclusion in training. The DTCF sets out the requirement for learning events to be “aligned with trainee motivation” and for resources to “actively engage the learner” in Competency Group 2. The requirement for trainees to “feel supported and able to relate their learning and development goals” and that their “achievement is used as a motivational tool” is set out in Competency Group 4. All the competencies in Group 2 and Competency 4.1 and 4.2 highlight the importance of considering both group and individual needs when planning, preparing and facilitating learning. Lessons should be planned to provide both support and challenge for trainees, so that all ability levels can achieve progress. Trainers must be able to support trainees in dealing with a range of different barriers to learning, including those linked to welfare, discipline and specific learning needs. Where the barrier is linked to trainee attitude, e.g. confidence, motivation or stress, the trainer will use coaching techniques to assist the trainee in dealing with this."

Trainees that fail assessments or otherwise do not meet the required standard of performance within the prescribed conditions should be given all available and practical opportunities to be provided with additional, or remedial, training in order to both give the trainee the best possible opportunity to pass the training activity. This will ensure the costs and resources expended on training are not wasted. Re-testing should only be conducted once the trainee has received remedial training to fill the Knowledge, Skill or Attitude gap. Re- testing without remedial training will likely be a waste of resource. A remedial training strategy should consider: the resources, time and trainer capacity necessary to deliver additional training. the most cost-effective way to deliver additional training (such as integrating remedial training with other or later training activities)."

    "content": "Assessment is an essential aspect of any training which must be properly understood and applied. Assessment requires the trainer to determine whether learning has occurred which requires making a judgement on trainee Performance and progress, then to decide whether the trainee is sufficiently competent in a particular Role or Task to be qualified for employment and/or work with or without supervision. The proper conduct of assessment in training can have a major impact on training time and resources, but ultimately will contribute directly to Defence outputs. Trainers should be able to administer assessments in training in a fair, valid and reliable manner, this is achieved through standardisation of conduct and moderation of marking: Standardisation. Standardisation is achieved by adhering to the direction given in the Assessment Strategy (AStrat), and the detail provided in the Assessment Specification (ASpec) . If an assessment is conducted using the same instructions every time, all trainees should receive exactly the same assessment, regardless of when, where and by whom the assessment is conducted. Moderation. Moderation of marking can also help to ensure that the marking of assessments by different trainers is equitable and fair. In this case, a random sample of marked assessments is marked again by another trainer without first seeing the original score or grades awarded. The resulting scores are then compared to see if they agree. Where scores do not agree, trainers should consult with other trainers, and as a team, identify where the marking system is flawed and adjust scores/grades accordingly. Any problems with the marking criteria should be highlighted to the DTS, DTM or Chain of Command."

    "content": "Although it takes many forms, Assessment serves one of two purposes: formative assessment that allows judgement or measurement of progress towards a goal or summative assessment that judges or measures whether that goal has been reached. Both measures can be norm referenced – making comparison with others (performance orientation) or criterion referenced – making comparison to a standard (mastery orientation). Assessment, then, is the primary measure available to the learner regarding their achievement. It is also the evidence base of that achievement. As with other learning activities the principles of motivation, goal orientation, believability, relevance (both to the operational requirement but also to that stage of development and learning) and trust are applicable. Assessment needs to be sufficiently challenging to be credible and to test deep learning should use higher levels of Blooms Taxonomy. Assessment, to be more than a process that just gathers data, must be meaningful to the organisation (actually constitute proof of competence) and be meaningful to the learner through a process of feedback."

Trainers should always use an up to date ASpec when planning an assessment. The main purpose of the ASpec is to control what is assessed and how. It is important Trainers assess all of the EOs and KLPs as specified in the ASpec and not make any changes that alter these. The manner in which the assessment is conducted is determined by the ASpec. Designers strive to provide as much realism as possible, sometimes by using simulation, instrumented or scenario-based activities and so unauthorised changes to the realism of a practical assessment may make it invalid. If limited resources make it difficult to deliver the assessment in the recommended way or the ASpec appears too restrictive, the DTS, DTM or Chain of Command should be informed."

The proper conduct of assessments in the workplace is critical to the assurance of Defence outputs, since it requires making a judgement on trainee performance and progress and to decide on whether they are sufficiently competent in a particular task to be qualified to work without supervision. Trainers should be able to administer assessments in a fair, valid and reliable manner according to the specifications provided. This is particularly important because workplace assessments may not be conducted under the same conditions that would usually be expected in more structured training environment. Workplace assessments are generally practical in nature and are used to test individuals or teams in the achievement of a Skill, or Skills, both mental and physical. They can assess either the product of the Skill or the process involved in employing the Skills and should have an associated checklist to ensure both reliability and objectivity in assessment. The WTS will often require the trainees to be assessed on a Skill that has already been practised and assessed in a simulated environment but which now needs to be confirmed in a live environment. It is important that workplace assessments are conducted in a context that properly reflects the real challenges of the Role. Workplace assessments can be either formative or summative.

Trainee welfare has a big impact on how successful trainees are in training. Trainers need to create an environment of mutual support and respect where trainees feel safe and know that their contributions are recognised and valued. Commanders have specific responsibilities relating to Care and Welfare; these are detailed in Volume 4 JSP 822."

In all cases, trainers should understand the following when adapting training delivery to meet the realities of training: All KLPs should be delivered in accordance with the LSpec.

    "content": "The purpose of using coaching techniques is to unlock a trainee’s potential in order to improve and maximise performance. It is about helping trainees learn for themselves rather than delivering training to them. Coaching techniques form an integral part of the trainer’s toolbox. Everything should be geared towards ensuring that trainees are successful. Often that simply means responding positively and constructively to their efforts and setting new challenges for them. There will also be times when a more focused individual approach is needed (e.g. to develop a trainee who is struggling, or to motivate a trainee who is finding training too easy). Coaching techniques form the basis of the Defence trainer course, and of learner-centric training, in order to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of training are maximised. There is no single definition of Mentoring in Defence as the word has different meanings depending on the context. For example, Informal Workplace Training includes mentoring schemes where a trusted colleague shares knowledge and experience over a period of time to assist a new colleague; there are mentoring schemes to assist foreign forces to manage their own security. Each has different aims. Where mentoring is mentioned in this JSP, it is referring primarily to the Role of the Defence Trainer Supervisor (DTS) who acts as a mentor for Trainers. In the DTS context the definition of Mentoring is: ‘where a trusted colleague shares knowledge and experience over a period of time to assist a new colleague’. Trainers should be introduced to the learning technologies available in their unit during the unit induction programme. Trainers should never discount the use of a learning technology because they do not know how to use it, but instead they should watch and learn from other Defence Trainers or ask for training from their DTS and/or chain of command."

There should be an expectation that trainers will perform to the highest standards and there should be incentive for high performance.

While potential trainers will normally be identified by their chain of command through appraisal30 and reporting processes, it is in the interests of the training establishment if trainers are volunteers rather than ‘pressed’. You should therefore aim to highlight and promote the benefits and incentives linked to specialist training provision both within the unit and externally wherever possible. As an example, some training provision posts offer significant elective accreditation possibilities, with the opportunity to achieve national teaching qualifications and professional recognition in the FE sector; this could be widely promoted on orders but also on career courses, with signposts in place to direct interested parties to further information. Identifying potential DTS. The DTS role is not necessarily a full-time employment role and may be carried out in addition to other training duties. You may therefore need to identify potential DTS from within your existing staff in order to maintain a suitable complement of supervisory staff. Potential DTS should be qualified Defence Trainers who have ideally achieved the Advanced Practitioner level. Selecting Defence Trainers. Some training establishments may require the DTM to organise or provide support to centralised selection cadres to explicitly test individuals’ aptitude as a potential trainer within that specific training context. Equally, you may be required to assist in the selection process for civilian or contracted training staff. Strong leadership and role modelling are critical attributes for a Defence Trainer in any phase of training; the selection process should also take into account the likely needs and expectations of the trainees in that environment.

Assessment of competence. As part of the training establishment induction process, an initial assessment of level of continuing competence is to be undertaken (within 3 months of completion of pre-employment training including any supervisory care training). This is to be conducted by an appropriately qualified DTS or equivalent. For newly qualified Defence Trainers and DTSs, this is included within the requirements of the WTS. For, previously qualified staff arriving in post, or those returning from an extended period of absence, detachment or operational tour, separate arrangements must be made to observe and assess their competence in the workplace at the earliest opportunity. Workplace Training Statement (WTS). For those who complete a WTS, responsibility for its completion lies with the employing unit and the individual. It is critical in ensuring the initial transfer of learning from the pre-employment training course into the workplace context. Pre-employment training provides trainers with an introduction to the learning theories and techniques so that they can start to use their trainer skills under supervision, but these skills must then be monitored and developed in the context of the relevant training establishment if the individual is to develop as an effective trainer. New trainers must feel confident, particularly in the first few months of their new employment, that they have the support of their superiors, so that they can try newly learned skills and learn from their mistakes, using a blend of pre-determined tasks and/or problem solving as well as learning from on-the-job experience and coach/mentor feedback.

The focus of CPD is firmly on you as an individual, so one size doesn’t fit all.

Your CPD plan should map out what you personally need to achieve in order to reach your development goals. The plan is specific to you and so there is no set format, but a Defence planning template is available from DCTS if you wish to use it. To create the plan, you need to do the following: Step 1: Identify your goals. One of the problems that people face when trying to improve their performance is defining what they want to achieve and how they need to develop. It will help to discuss your goals with someone else, e.g. a DTS, your line manager, or you may wish to seek advice from a professional body that you are a member of. You may also find that it helps to create a performance profile when setting goals. DCTS has a proforma to help with this."

It is a combination of firm discipline, high quality rigorous training, maintenance of high standards, a sense of fair play, treating the trainee as an individual and encouraging people to achieve tasks and skills far beyond those that they first thought themselves capable of. Training is successful if it results in a high level of skill, self-discipline, initiative and obedience to orders in the moment of crisis. Successful training also delivers independent learners, who are motivated to continue to learn through life and thus are able to deal with the complex, the uncertain and the unexpected. Defence training is characterised by a strong sense of purpose, relevance to the operational environment and the will to develop the core Values and Standards of the Armed Forces in the individual. Skill, strength and forbearance are admired and encouraged; there is no place for cruelty, callousness or meanness. A strong sense of appropriate humour pervades the way in which this training is delivered. This defines the challenge to those who deliver Defence training, each of whom will be held as a role model to the trainee in all that they do. The Defence Code of Practice for Trainers applies to all Service and civilian trainers employed by the Ministry of Defence. Underpinned by the core Values and Standards of the Armed Forces, it serves to unify and complement the various training courses provided for the different trainer roles, by setting out common standards of practice which are central to the delivery of Defence training. All trainers are expected to adhere to the Code’s ethos and meet the standards set out within it."

    "content": "Standards in Training. All trainees should be given the same opportunity to learn and achieve. The trainer promotes an inclusive learning culture by helping trainees to avoid or deal with different barriers to learning. This can present a challenge, particularly in Phase 1 and 2 training, to get the right balance between encouraging and supporting a trainee whose true potential may only be faintly visible, and warning, perhaps even helping to discharge, those who are never going to achieve the required standard. Each case must be treated on its own merits and you should make every effort to motivate and support your trainees, but this should not be at the expense of the standards required to maintain operational effectiveness. In all cases, you should focus first on 'training in' rather than 'selecting out'. Respect in Training. It is important that a relationship exists between the trainer and trainee based on mutual respect. Respect from a trainee cannot be demanded or expected; you must never abuse your position of authority. Good trainers will continually seek to develop the trainee's self-belief with constructive criticism and encouragement, and will naturally be afforded respect as a result. Physically striking or humiliating a trainee or the use of threatening, rude or abusive language is counterproductive and is not tolerated within the Armed Services."

    "content": "Sensible and Achievable Training. Training must be progressive, safe and sensibly achievable. Safe training does not mean being over-cautious, unadventurous or dull but you must not push trainees faster than they can learn and they must be allowed time to learn from their mistakes. Consider your audience carefully when planning training, and make sure that your expectations take into account the background, military knowledge and experience of your trainees. Challenging Training. Phase 1 training by its very nature presents a considerable challenge to a young person but care should be taken to ensure that subsequent and further training also challenges every trainee mentally, physically and intellectually. If not, they may feel patronised and quickly become demotivated. This applies particularly to Phase 3 training, where trainees will have greater breadth of maturity and military experience. You should always acknowledge trainees’ previous experience and aim to provide sufficient challenge for all levels of background and ability. Safety in Training. If training is to be effective, it must include exposure to the conditions (real or simulated) that will be present in operations. This will often incorporate some level of risk. Whilst risk management is the duty of the chain of command, responsibility will also rest with the trainer in direct control of the activity. You must therefore manage risk in order to deliver training as safely as possible. Where you believe, in a particular situation, that the training benefits are outweighed by real risks to life and limb, you have a duty to step in and modify the training. Training safety will be enhanced by application of the following principles:"

    "section": "Standards for the Delivery of Training",
    "content": "Risk Assessment. Prior to conducting training, a risk assessment must be completed by a competent (qualified, experienced and current) individual. Nevertheless, you must always conduct your own assessment prior to the start of training and, if applicable, record any deviations from the lesson plan. You should continue to review that assessment during training in order to adapt to changing conditions (equipment, weather, tiredness, etc). If appropriate, trainees should be briefed on any changes in the plan resulting from a revised risk assessment. Safety Instructions. Before any training commences an appropriate set of safety orders/instructions are to be published and a safety briefing must always be given based on those orders/instructions. Repetitive training may be covered by standing orders, provided that these are briefed at regular intervals. Orders and instructions should include any actions to be taken in the event of an emergency. Trainer/Trainee Ratios. For many training activities, including adventurous training, weapons training and physical training, there will be a recommended ratio of trainers to trainees. You must be aware of the guidelines and plan the training accordingly."

    "content": "Competition in Training. Competition between individuals or teams involving mental or physical endeavour can be an excellent tool for improving performance, developing robustness and the desire to win. You should strive to encourage healthy competition in your training but, balance and care are always required to ensure that trainees are encouraged and motivated but not demoralised. Humour in Training. Humour is a powerful tool in the provision of effective training. You should, where possible, aim to make training fun so that a trainee will find it memorable and will be looking forward to the next session; however, care must be taken to avoid misdirected humour. Knowing where to draw the line can be difficult, particularly with trainees who you do not know you as well as you know your colleagues. Anything that belittles trainees is definitely NOT appropriate and is almost certain to create a barrier to learning which will then have to be dealt with later. If in doubt about a remark, don’t use it. Accountability in training. A trainer is accountable for both the training and well- being of all trainees. This demands total commitment and a sense of responsibility. The successful trainer will be prepared to spend extra time coaching or providing informal tuition to assist trainees in overcoming barriers to learning. You should also be prepared to provide a sympathetic ear when trainees need to discuss issues outside of training, particularly (but not exclusively) in training environments where they are living away from home. You need to be able to signpost and refer trainees to specialist support as required."

    "content": "Leadership. Trainers are expected to set the highest standards of motivational and inspirational leadership at all times, and to demonstrate, by example, the same leadership expected on operations. A good trainer uses motivational feedback to develop trust and inspire confidence and self-belief in trainees. You should communicate enthusiasm, encourage perseverance and always be optimistic of trainee success. You must also have the moral courage to demonstrate sound principles, high personal standards, values and a strong code of ethics at all times; but particularly when making decisions under stress. Good leadership is vital in this respect and you should participate fully in the rigors and hardship of training and inspire your trainees through commitment and example. Equality in Training. All trainees must be accorded fair and equal treatment, whatever their rank, gender, sexual orientation, religion, social background, race or ethnic origin. No harassment, intimidation, abuse, humiliation or unlawful discrimination of any kind will be tolerated anywhere within the Armed Forces. You must lead by example: you should make it absolutely clear that you disapprove of any form of discrimination and you should foster an environment where a complaint can be made without fear of retribution. Discipline in training You must clearly understand your disciplinary powers as published in the orders and regulations of your organisation. Unofficial disciplinary procedures can be interpreted as bullying or as an abuse of authority and, for these reasons, all disciplinary action must be clearly recorded and open for inspection. Nevertheless, you should not defer giving reasonable but firm orders or taking appropriate action for fear that they will be challenged by a trainee on the grounds of, for example, harassment. Moral courage must be exercised at all times and any inappropriate behaviour or poor attitude/effort towards training must be challenged."

Evaluation activities do not focus solely on the provision of training (although this is a key activity) but also on the DSAT process and the Training System as a whole, including the Management Training System (MTS). In addition to evaluation, Element 4 activities includes Training Needs Evaluation (TNE) which is Stage 3 of the Training Needs Analysis (TNA). Evaluation activities are detailed in the Training Quality Manual (TQM) which is endorsed at the Customer Executive Board (CEB). The DSAT Quaity Management System (QMS) is key to assisting those involved in the evaluation of Defence training.

A measuring instrument is valid if it measures what it is intended to measure. For example, in training the most valid measuring instrument for a practical Skill is a practical test. A written test may well test whether the trainee knows what to do in a practical task but not if they can actually do it. Reliability. A measuring instrument is reliable if it gives consistent results. For example, a test or questionnaire, when administered to two very similar groups, would not be reliable unless it gave similar results. If it is a reliable measuring instrument it should also give similar results when it is administered twice to the same group at different times."

Confidence in the findings is enhanced when the techniques yield similar results. For example, if the outcomes of a questionnaire-based survey correspond to the findings of an observational study of the same phenomena, the more the analyst will be confident of the findings. In addition to the use of 2 or more data collection tools, triangulation can also be achieved using 2 or more analysts using the same research instrument. Factors that influence trainees’ reaction to training. Despite the evaluators' best efforts to design feedback mechanisms which are both reliable and valid, it is important to realise that there is a range of external factors that may influence the content of InVal feedback. Every attempt should be made to take these into consideration when conducting an analysis. For example, trainees' reactions to training can be influenced by many factors, including: Their relationship with their trainer."

    "content": "Aims. The first aim of ExVal (Stage 3) is to determine the success of training in preparing individuals for their Role and whether the requirement is still valid. The following must be considered: Timing. Initially, after training, an individual’s motivation will be increased. Performance, however, frequently suffers as people try to ‘unlearn’ old behaviours and practise new skills. Therefore, the timing of ExVal should be determined by both the length and complexity of the training activity that is being validated. Usually, an ExVal would be implemented between 6-18 months after the completion of training. On the other hand, if too long a period is left between the training event and the ExVal, it will be difficult to ascertain which KSA have been acquired as a result of training and which have been learnt subsequently. Methodology. Some measurement of Behavioural change may have already been made during the assessment of trainee performance during training. However, in order to ascertain the full impact of training on individual performance in the workplace, further analysis must be undertaken. The process through which data is collected and analysed in order to inform ExVal should be planned. This is typically via questionnaire-based feedback mechanisms5. Questionnaires will normally be distributed to both ex-trainees and their respective line managers at least 6 months after the completion of training. The questionnaire should examine the degree to which the TOs relating to a particular training activity remain relevant to the employment area they were designed to support. The questionnaire should also serve as a mechanism through which data can be gathered on wider aspects of the training process, and must be responsive to the needs of all stakeholders. The questionnaire should also give Training Providers a common method of determining"

Activities such as audits of the training process, trainer monitoring, management reports and other data gathered through the InVal process can all be used to inform ExVal. The aim of Stage 4 Evaluation is to assess overall benefits to the organisation of a particular training activity and whether it offered VfM. This Stage of evaluation is challenging in an organisation the size of the MOD. Defence Performance and Risk reporting mechanisms mean it is possible to measure whether training has directly contributed to Defence outputs by measuring performance against the Defence Board Defence Tasks which are, essentially, Defence’s organisational goals. To evaluate business benefits to the organisation, training should be linked to the Defence Tasks and their subordinate SC objectives. Those conducting Stage 4 Evaluation should bear in mind that there are many other factors external to training which may impact business performance (such as redundancy programmes, leadership in the workplace etc). JSP 507 provides guidance on the evaluation of projects including the assessment of whether VfM was achieved. Responsibilities. It is the responsibility of TRA to conduct ExVal. The TRA may employ an ExVal team for the planning, coordination and implementation of the ExVal and for the dissemination of the results. In doing so the team will need to draw on the experiences of many of those involved in the training process who should be encouraged to take individual responsibility for the conduct of ExVal.

A measuring instrument is reliable if it gives consistent results when the same entities are measured under the same conditions.

Alternate form reliability, however, would need to be demonstrated. Discrimination. A measuring instrument should be sensitive enough to record differences between individuals in what is being measured. Similarly, the inability to discriminate between satisfactory and unsatisfactory training is of no use. Practicability. Any assessment of training must be administratively practicable. A theoretically superb assessment system is of no use if practical limitations, such as time, cost or workforce considerations prevent it from being used."

    "content": "There are several ethical considerations that need to be adhered to throughout the data collection process7. The respondents’ right to privacy and the right to refuse to answer certain questions, or to be interviewed at all, should always be respected, and no undue pressure should be brought to bear. The reason for this caution whilst undertaking data collection is not only for the interviewee’s benefit but also for the interviewer’s. If an interviewee believes that answering questions honestly will harm them then they are more likely to give bland, misleading and uninformative answers. Any evaluation based on such data is invalid. When conducting interviews a manner conducive to following sound ethical considerations should be followed. Examples are: Honesty. The interviewer should portray a non-threatening manner and remain truthful and faithful to the purpose of the interview. This ensures that the interviewee also gives honest answers to any questions. Impartiality. Regardless of the analyst’s own particular viewpoint, an interview or questionnaire analysis should remain objective, valid, reliable and accurate. No attempt should be made to persuade a respondent to agree with the analyst’s perspective. For example, an interviewer must be careful not to ask leading questions."

Confidentiality. If the data collected is to remain confidential, and the analyst has stated this, then confidentiality must be observed. If the respondent wishes to remain anonymous and if the analyst agrees then this agreement must also be observed. It may also be important that it is explained who will see the data collected and the analysis of the collected data. Such openness on the part of the analyst leads to respondents being equally open."

A numerical value is then assigned to each category. Qualitative data gathering. Qualitative data can be defined as data gathered on individuals’, feelings, opinions, beliefs etc using open ended questioning. Qualitative methods allow the study of selective issues in depth and detail. Qualitative data consist of detailed textual information rather than numerical information generated by quantitative techniques.

It is rarely possible to record all that a respondent says during an interview and it would be of little value in any case since all the answers would then appear to be different. What is necessary is the grouping of answers under suitable headings, so that the completed schedule will indicate clearly and concisely what the interviewee may have taken a quarter of an hour to say. It is then appropriate for the interviewer to indicate how the answer has been recorded (e.g. “Am I right in putting you down as saying?”). This gives the respondent time to think again and for the interviewer to check that what has been said has really been understood. If the answer does not fit under an already accepted heading then it must be inserted under a new heading, which will in turn be available for all subsequent interviews. A pocket-dictating machine may be useful but permission must be gained to use one. Recording interviews can also inhibit interviewees. Attempt to transcribe a recording is prohibitive due to the amount of time required. It may be worth considering the use of a second team member to record responses.

The interviewer can check that the respondent has understood technical expressions and terms which have been used in the questionnaire. For example, a term like ‘Defence Writing’ is open to numerous interpretations. To one person it may mean the mechanics of writing, i.e. layout, conventions etc, while to another it concerns matters of style and content."

    "content": "Requirements. Observation involves watching, recording and analysing. Observing a particular activity is influenced by the fact that human perception is highly subjective. The fact that an individual is equipped with functioning senses does not make that person a skilled observer. Different people looking at the same design or object will see different things, due in part to their interests, biases and backgrounds. Coding. The observation may be unstructured, with the person who is observing being as open-minded as possible and using his or her judgement about which events are considered important. Alternatively, it may be highly structured by the use of coded schedules that guide attention to specific types of event. The categories that are selected will be those where changes are expected as a result of training, or those that are thought to be particularly important to the success of the Role. Unstructured observations should be avoided. Use pre-determined criteria to increase the reliability and validity of the data collected. Advantages and disadvantages of observations. Observation of procedure is important in the areas of skills training and relates particularly to the areas of speed, sequencing, manual dexterity and safety. As with questionnaires and interviews, to be effective, observations require formal structure in the form of an observation schedule. The advantages and disadvantages of gathering data by observation are highlighted as follows:"

    "content": "Quantitative and qualitative data analysis. Quantitative data by their very nature lend themselves to statistical analysis. However, with qualitative data there may be trends (patterns, themes) present, which could go unnoticed. One of the problems of dealing with qualitative data is the ‘blizzard of information’ that can be reproduced. This can often be unstructured in content and resource intensive in terms of workforce and time to analyse. Such considerations need to be included during initial project management planning. In analysing qualitative data the quality of the analyst must be taken into consideration, as unlike quantitative data analysis where the issues are more readily identifiable, qualitative analysis requires greater degree(s) of interpretation. Analysts must be conscious of the possibility of knee jerk reactions when confronting data for the first time Qualitative data allow a vast amount of (potentially wide-ranging) information to be considered, allowing the respondent to provide depth of feeling over complex issues which may be difficult to elicit by purely quantitative terms alone. That said, in order to obtain a full picture, qualitative data should not be treated in isolation, but should be compared with quantitative data. Triangulation of data. Triangulation is the combination of different data gathering techniques to investigate the same issue and will usually combine both quantitative and qualitative data methods. For example, rather than simply completing a questionnaire in respect of how an individual performs a task, they might also be interviewed and observed conducting the task. The use of questionnaires together with observation, or qualitative with quantitative data gathering techniques, for example, can reduce the chance of distorting the results or introducing bias within the methodology. To that end triangulation allows greater confidence in the research results regardless of the data gathering methodologies applied."

    "content": "For the purpose of this handbook, competence retention is defined as “the knowledge, skills and underpinning attitudinal dispositions that must be acquired and maintained by individuals in order to effectively perform tasks to a pre-defined standard of proficiency”. Competence Retention Analysis (CRA) is a scientific methodology developed as a practical approach to predicting the retention of different knowledge and skills that underpin military tasks at the workforce level. CRA is intended to assist Defence to reduce the impact of skill fade and enhance competence retention. It is relevant to two audiences as follows: Training analysts can use the outputs of CRA during the Training Needs Analysis (TNA) process to justify training solutions and the training budget; and"

CRA can also be used retrospectively to improve training design and to inform decision- making about the specification of training priorities (initial and refresher), where issues are identified during the TNA evaluation process. This CRA handbook replaces the Defence Human Capability Science and Technology Centre (DHCSTC) Task Identification Number (TIN) 2.057 CRA User Guide (Cahillane, MacLean & Webb, 2015) to incorporate new insights into the retention of different types of current and future knowledge and skills over time. These insights were established during a programme of research commissioned by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), through the Human and Social Sciences Research Capability (HSSRC) framework (Cahillane et al., 2020). A summary of what has changed within the Competence Retention Analysis Technique (CRA-T) and why, is presented in Section 1.2. Gaps in the science related to the CRA-T are covered in Section 1.3."

    "content": "knowledge and skills are retained at different rates over time. These insights can inform training design and delivery and the setting of refresher training intervals. The CRA-T approach has been updated to allow combinations and integrations of knowledge and skills to be considered. The original approach involved decomposing a task into subtasks and identifying the ‘predominant psychological domain’ for each subtask. This approach failed to acknowledge that the predominant domain is not always that which is most susceptible to skill fade. It also prevented identification of where combinations of two or more domains underpin subtasks or where skills are integrated. In this handbook, CRA now requires decomposition of a task/Training Objective (TO) into subtasks/Enabling Objectives (EOs) and task elements/Key Learning Points (KLPs). Decomposing tasks down to the task element/KLP level enables a detailed identification of the knowledge and skills needed for an adequate understanding of the task. By doing so, it becomes possible to identify the psychological domain most susceptible to decay and map that to the subtask/EO, rather than the predominant domain. The CRA-T considers other factors, including task frequency, which may affect the retention of the knowledge and skills that underpin task performance. These additional factors have been updated to include those known to moderate the acquisition and retention of complex cognitive skills and implicit knowledge."

    "content": "The CRA-T provides an indicative model of knowledge and skill retention, which may be exploited to give practical, usable advice and quick wins to optimise competence retention. It also provides training design and delivery options for competence acquisition and retention. The early development of the CRA-T was underpinned by best practice from the scientific literature and an existing predictive model of skills retention known as the User Decision Aid (UDA) (Rose, Radtke et al., 1985; see Appendix B for background on competence retention key concepts). The CRA-T process has since been updated with reference to new insights from the science and from Defence and Security case studies (Cahillane et al., 2020). The CRA-T can be used to indicate the percentage of a workforce (e.g., a unit) which will remain competent after a specified period of non-practice or application, based on the types of skills and knowledge that are characteristic of their job or task. This allows the operational readiness of a workforce to be estimated."

    "content": "The CRA-T provides a method to identify how long knowledge and skills will be retained if they are not applied or practised, but it does not consider attitudes because these do not decay over time. The CRA-T does not indicate retention beyond 12 months of non-practice or application. The CRA-T can be applied to individual tasks at the workforce level but cannot indicate retention for individual tasks at an individual level. Therefore, the CRA-T cannot be used to identify the point at which an individual’s task performance would fall below a set level. ‘The Predictive Performance Equation (PPE)’, is a potential alternative to CRA (Peebles, 2020). The PPE can predict individual performance over periods ranging from days to months and can therefore support training designers in tailoring refresher training to an individual’s particular requirements. Application of the PPE is likely to be most suitable for specialised training courses, where an understanding of individual requirements for refresher training is needed. See Peebles (2020) for information on the type of training or performance data that is required to make use of the PPE."

    "content": "The type of training documentation available will depend on the current stage of the DSAT process.

These provide training analysts with a suitable input to CRA. The Task Scalar provides an understanding of the skills and decomposes high-level tasks into subtasks and task elements. The KSA analysis, which is updated during the design phase of the DSAT process, provides an understanding of the knowledge and skills required to perform the task/job. For the training designer, in addition to the Task Scalar, RPS and early KSA analysis outputs, other relevant training documentation could include the Training Performance Statement (TPS), a Competence Framework (CF), and the Learning Scalar. A DSAT-compliant Learning Scalar decomposes the TO into EOs and KLPs. As more than one type of knowledge and/or skill can underpin an EO, the KLPs will provide the granularity needed to perform CRA and articulate the knowledge and skills required to complete the EOs.

When performing Step 2, look at the scalar and the psychological knowledge and skill domain definitions (see Table 2 and Table 3) and match the task elements/KLPs and the subtasks/EOs to the psychological domains. Considering the action verb used to describe the task elements/KLPs and subtask/EOs will help in mapping to the correct psychological domains. For example, the action verb ‘Describe’ indicates the Explicit Knowledge domain underpins performance. However, the action verb may not always provide a clear and practical indication of the psychological knowledge or skill domain being applied in the conduct of the task element/KLP or subtask/EO. For example, ‘Manage’ could indicate the Procedural skills or Simple Decision-making skills domain. Therefore, Subject Matter Expert (SME) knowledge of the task/job role is needed in order to best match task elements/KLPs and subtasks/EOs to the psychological domains. In some cases, it may also be necessary to look at the steps (i.e., the next level of granularity below the task element/KLP) to better inform understanding of the domains required at the task element/KLP level."

    "content": "The purpose of Step 3 is to consider the impact of how often subtasks/EOs are performed on the retention of knowledge and skills. This is because the frequency with which knowledge and skills are practised can moderate the rate at which they fade over time. As an example, a subtask/EO mapped to the Procedural skills domain would be expected to have a low level of retention in comparison to other psychological domains (refer to Figure 3). However, Table 8 demonstrates how frequency of application moderates the alignment of psychological domains to a particular retention level. It uses the same traffic light system as Figure 3: GREEN meaning high retention (greater than 50% of workforce competent after 12 months non-practice); AMBER meaning moderate retention (50% of workforce competent after 5 months non-practice); and RED meaning low retention (50% of the workforce competent after 2 months non-practice). Therefore, if the same subtask/EO mapped to the Procedural skills domain was performed very frequently, the expected retention level would be moderate, rather than low. Information on the frequency with which subtasks/EOs are performed can be obtained from the DIF analysis, which is gathered during the TNA. If a TNA/DIF analysis is not available, then SME judgement should be used."

Consequently, frequency is considered at the subtask/EO level rather than the task element/KLP level.

The retention of these knowledge and skills relies heavily on job holders being able to hold a lot of information, procedures and/or stepped decisional processes in working memory. The effect of the factors on retention, matched to the psychological domain underpinning the very critical or moderately critical subtask/EO, should be considered. It is necessary to have an understanding of the context in which a subtask/EO is conducted in order to effectively consider where these influencing factors could be designed into training to maximise retention. For example, where a well-designed and mandated job aid exists for a subtask/EO that was originally matched to the Procedural or Simple Decision-making domain in Step 2, then the subtask/EO may now be remapped to another domain as appropriate. This is because memory for the procedures, or stepped decisional processes, which are now represented by the job aid is no longer required. For example, the subtask/EO mapped to the Procedural domain in Table 5 would now be remapped to the Explicit Knowledge domain. Subtasks/EOs matched to the Explicit Knowledge psychological domain have a high (GREEN) level of retention regardless of frequency (see Table 8)."

    "section": "Developing Graphical Representations of Task Mental Models",
    "content": "The acquisition and retention of implicit knowledge and complex cognitive skills that underpin complex tasks is enhanced by the development of a strong mental model. A mental model is a mental representation of a task, which captures how it is understood or conceptualised and performed. It includes an understanding of the task components and the purpose(s) of the whole task and its subtasks/EOs, the conceptual relationships between subtasks/EOs, and how they work together during performance of the whole task. Developing a strong mental model is a key factor influencing the acquisition and retention of implicit knowledge and complex cognitive skills. This is because a strong mental model provides the conceptual ‘glue’ required to bind subtask/EO components (i.e., task elements/KLPs) in long-term memory. It also aids the encoding of task complexity. The positive effect on retention of the other influencing factors summarised in Table 14, is dependent on the acquisition of a strong mental model. Mental models enable trainees to mentally acquire, organise and retain a wide range of task types from the simple to the complex. The more complex the task, the more important it is for the mind to be able to develop, retain and update the mental model for the task. In general, individuals are not conscious of their task mental models and do not explicitly articulate them. However, mental models for any task can be explicitly articulated through analysis to identify what has to be learned. By analysing the mental model, the conceptual relationships between the subtasks/EOs can be identified. These can then be specified as additional KLPs and incorporated into the training design and delivery. It is important to note that these KLPs would not have been identified using traditional KSA analysis techniques. The external representation of a task’s mental model can be captured graphically to enable visualisation of complexity. The external representation enables visualisation of the conceptual relationships between the subtasks/EOs listed and detailed in the Task/Learning Scalar. These relationships represent the task concept and where, when, and how subtasks/EOs work together during whole task performance. The greater the number of relationships, the more complex the task. Having identified the complexity of the task, training can be designed to support acquisition and retention of complex tasks. If this is done successfully, the jobholder will have acquired the strong, subconscious, mental representation of the task required for proficient performance; however, job holders should not be expected to describe their mental model."

    "content": "Simple tasks are underpinned by physical and/or simple cognitive skills and involve discrete subtasks/EOs that are performed separately. Such discrete subtasks/EOs can be performed in isolation from each other and there are no conceptual relationships between them. For example, Figure 4 shows the simple task of ‘Ironing a shirt’. Here, there is a single relationship (i.e., link) radiating out from the whole task to each subtask/EO. To illustrate, setting up the ironing equipment can be conducted independently of thinking about the other subtasks/EOs. Mental models for simple tasks do not need to be made explicit during training. This is because the retention of simple tasks is determined by working memory capacity i.e., memory for procedurals and/or stepped decisional processes. Figure 4 – Example of a simple task –‘Ironing a shirt’ In contrast with simple tasks, complex tasks involve complex cognitive skills. They may also involve physical and/or simple cognitive skills. The subtasks/EOs of complex tasks can be performed separately or concurrently, but conceptual relationships will exist between two or more of the subtasks/EOs. Complex tasks require the acquisition of a strong and flexible (i.e., adaptable) mental model. To support acquisition and retention of a complex task, it is important for training designers to explicitly specify this task mental model. This can be done by developing an external representation, which illustrates the conceptual understanding that has to be developed in the learner through practice. This then allows the training designer to identify the conceptual learning points which will support subconscious acquisition of the task mental model."

    "content": "These coordinated relationships relate to aspects of sequencing, timing, frequency, dependency, or location between pairs of subtasks/EOs. For example, the subtask/EO of Conduct Project Planning is an essential part of a bathroom renovation and begins with the setting the budget (i.e., sequencing) and its ongoing management as the project evolves. Ongoing management requires coordination in terms of timing (budget usually comes first). Managing the Budget is dependent on ongoing adjustments to the project plan, resulting from changes in other subtasks/EO. For example, it may be necessary to cancel the purchase of previously selected materials due to unforeseen delays in the supply chain. Updating the budget as a result of changes to the plan is likely to be frequent, given the component complexity. The timing of the selection and purchase of materials is coordinated with the project plan. If selected materials become unavailable, project planning, and by extension the budget, will have to be updated accordingly. The selection of skilled tradespersons (e.g., plasterer, plumber, electrician, and tiler) relates to the project plan and the budget. This initially involves establishing communication and gathering quotations and estimates. The success of the project plan is dependent on the selection of tradespersons early in the project. Other coordinated subtasks/EOs, i.e., Quality Control and Manage Tradespersons, may highlight the need within the project plan to replace one or more of the initially selected tradespersons, thus reactivating the relationship with the Select Tradespersons subtask/EO. As consequence, the budget may need to be updated."

For example, some jobs will have to be done before others: The plumber will need to decommission the old bathroom and cap- off the water pipes before other work can commence and the plasterer will have to complete their work before tiling can begin. Even if there are no dependencies between some activities, the size of the workspace (i.e., location) may determine how many tradespersons can be working at any one time. In order to ensure that the renovation work is being carried out to the standards agreed at the time of selection, the ongoing subtask/EO of Quality Control is coordinated with the Management of Tradespersons. In Figure 5, the outer circle surrounding the task and subtasks/EOs comprises a dotted line with a single dotted line arrow pointing towards the task. With reference to the key to symbols for dimensions of complexity in Table 15, this type of circle and arrow indicates that dynamic complexity is low for this task. There are few expected input/output changes to one or more subtasks/EOs. Thus, the impact on whole task performance resulting from an increase in cognitive demand is correspondingly low. An example of an input change to the ‘Select Tradespersons’ subtask/EO would be where a tradesperson is no longer available. This would result in an adjustment (i.e., output change) to the ‘Conduct Project Planning’ subtask/EO. However, if more dynamic input/output changes to one or more subtasks/EOs were to be expected, the task mental model could be adjusted by using the symbol for high dynamic complexity (see Table 15)."

This ensures the integrative conceptual ‘glue’, essential for the effective integration of the other psychological skills underpinning task elements/KLPs, is addressed in the design of the training. The mental model in Figure 6 illustrates how multiple, interdependent subtasks/EOs have to be integrated (i.e., performed concurrently) for successful performance of the whole task. The conceptual relationships between subtasks/EOs will become more or less activated during task performance, dependent upon task goals. Any new task inputs to the incident commander will require dynamic changes to the plan. In Figure 6, the outer circle surrounding the task and subtasks/EOs comprises a solid line with three arrows pointing towards the task. As can be seen from the key in Table 15, the dynamic complexity for this task is high. It is highly likely that there will be multiple input/output changes to one or more subtasks/EOs. An example of an input change to the ‘React to environmental impact’ subtask/EO would be where an unpredicted impact on the environment is identified by the incident commander (e.g., hazardous cargo exploding).

    "content": "To enable acquisition of complex tasks, the level of dynamic complexity should be designed into task exercises. Where a task mental model indicates high dynamic complexity, training designers and deliverers should ensure that learners practise responding to multiple dynamic (i.e., unpredictable) input/output changes to one or more subtasks/EOs. Conversely, where low dynamic complexity is indicated, training designers and deliverers should build in some dynamic input/output changes to one or more subtasks/EOs. This will exercise the conceptual relationships between the subtasks/EOs. By building in authentic, meaningful, varied, and unpredictable task inputs/outputs, training designers and deliverers will ensure the conceptual relationships between the subtasks/EOs are strongly bound in memory. How well complex cognitive tasks are acquired and retained is inferred from whole task performance and not the ability of trainees to describe or repeat the structure of the task mental model. Acquisition of strong mental models will enable job holders to respond effectively to dynamic complexity (i.e., new task inputs). If job holders understand the conceptual relationships between subtasks/EOs, they can consider how dynamic input changes to one or more subtasks/EOs may impact whole task performance. In summary, the complete Task/Learning Scalar with subtasks/EOs and task elements/KLPs matched to the psychological domains (i.e., Step 2 output) should be considered by a panel of SMEs to inform the development of the graphical mental model for the complex task. CTA as a supplement to traditional task analysis can support the identification and specification of the conceptual relationships between subtasks/EOs. The conceptual relationships drawn between the subtasks/EOs can then be specified as additional KLPs. These KLPs will make explicit how subtasks/EOs are conceptually related and can be incorporated into initial training.

This will provide a visual interpretation of the task’s complexity in terms of its components (i.e., subtasks/EOs) and the conceptual relationships that exist between them. Development of the graphical representation of the task mental model should be undertaken by a panel of SMEs, using: i) the complete Task/Learning Scalar with the subtasks/EOs and task elements/KLPs matched to psychological domains (i.e., Step 2 output); and ii) the symbols for dimensions of complexity (see Table 15). To further support the identification and specification of the conceptual relationships between subtasks/EOs, a CTA can be performed. The first step in developing a graphical representation of a task’s mental model is to draw the central circle representing the whole task, and then the outer circles representing the subtasks/EOs. These circles will illustrate the component complexity of the task. Next, links should be drawn between the subtasks/EOs to explicitly represent the task’s coordinative complexity and define the conceptual relationships, i.e., what conceptually ‘glues’ the sub-tasks/EOs together. The conceptual relationships will either be coordinated (but not integrated) or integrated (i.e., performed concurrently). An outer circle should then be drawn, with the line of the circle and arrows representative of the task’s dynamic complexity and thus the likely occurrence of dynamic input/output changes to one or more subtasks/EOs that may impact whole task performance. The greater the number of task components and conceptual relationships, and the higher the dynamic complexity, the more complex the task."

    "content": "Once the graphical representation of the mental model has been developed, the other factors known to improve retention of implicit knowledge and complex cognitive skills can be designed into training. For example, where integrated conceptual relationships have been identified between all subtasks/EOs because these are matched to the Integrative domain, then the complex task is fully integrated. Consequently, all subtasks/EOs should be brought together and practised and assessed as a whole task. This ensures the conceptual integrative ‘glue’, essential for the effective integration and coordination of the other psychological skills underpinning task elements/KLPs, is fully integrated into the training programme. However, if a complex task is only partially integrated, where some but not all subtasks/EOs are matched to the integrative domain, then it may be possible for some subtasks/EOs to be practised and assessed at the part task level. Having performed Step 5, the revised CRA-T process is now complete."

    "content": "Two predictive models of individual skill retention that consider multiple factors known to affect the retention of knowledge and skills have been identified. The US Army Research Institute’s (ARI) UDA model (Rose, Radtke et al., 1985) predicts knowledge and skills retention by rating task-based characteristics of individual tasks, whereas its revised version, the Trainers’ Decision Aid (TDA) includes training-related factors in addition to those which are tasked-based (Cianciolo et al., 2010). The UDA was identified as the only fully developed predictive model that considers multiple factors known to be strong predictors of knowledge and skills retention. In developing the original CRA-T for the User Guide, the UDA was applied by SMEs to tasks representative of the following domains: Explicit Knowledge, Continuous Psychomotor, Discrete Psychomotor, Simple Decision-making, and Procedural skills (Cahillane et al., 2013). The set of tasks cases were defined in consultation with Defence stakeholders, with each representing the application of one of the psychological domains. Application of the UDA resulted in a series of indicative retention curves for the generic psychological knowledge and skill domains (see Figure 7). The UDA model assumes no practice has taken place in the generation of predicted retention curves."

    "content": "The retention level definitions are fixed at the 50% point and cannot be adjusted, given the current level of validation for the CRA-T. The low (RED), moderate (AMBER) and high (GREEN) retention levels should be considered as indicative of when refresher training is required and not conclusive. This is because the CRA-T is based on the UDA predictive skills retention model, which was originally developed for tasks requiring the recall of procedures and stepped processes. In addition, although this predictive skills retention model has received some validation, it has not been widely validated and is known to be pessimistic. In general, the UDA predicts on average a smaller percentage of a workforce will be competent than the actual performance data would suggest. For some tasks, this difference has been as large as 30% (Rose, Czarnolewski et al., 1985). Although the retention levels in Table 18 are based on retention curves that may be pessimistic, they can be considered as representative of the worst-case scenario. This is in terms of the percentage of a workforce indicated to be competent after a period of non-practice or application. To date, the CRA-T is the only scientific methodology developed as a practical approach to predicting knowledge and skills retention at the workforce level. Further research and/or the collection of performance data is required to validate the indicative retention level definitions more widely. It is also required to"

    "section": "Prediction Limitations and Assumptions",
    "content": "Those applying the CRA-T should be aware that its existing retention levels (red, amber, and green) are based on decay curves generated by the application of the UDA model. Although the UDA is based on task-related factors that are known to influence the retention of explicit knowledge, physical and simple cognitive skills, the algorithm applied in the generation of its decay curves is based on the aggregation of individual performance data. Therefore, the decay curves represent the percentage of a workforce predicted to remain proficient after a period of time has elapsed since the knowledge or skill was last applied. Given the CRA-T extant retention levels are based on UDA-generated retention curves, they do not indicate knowledge and skill fade at the level of the individual. It follows that the CRA-T retention levels cannot be used to identify the point at which an individual’s performance would fall below criterion. The CRA-T retention bandings assume 100% of personnel within a workforce or unit are competent at the end of their last training session. They also assume that the workforce has received the same training, to the same standard, and that personnel meet the same level of proficiency at the time of skill acquisition. To address these limitations, new decay explanations of knowledge and skills retention must be based on individual retention of acquired knowledge and skills over an extended period of non-use. Key to the generation of individual skills retention curves is the requirement for a standardised approach where the same individuals: i) are at or above a criterion performance level; ii) have had equivalent training experience during acquisition; and iii) have been assessed at the point of acquisition and after a specified retent ion interval(s). Guidance for the collection of longitudinal empirical evidence is covered in a Top Tips document for the Planning, Conduct and Analysis of Future skill Fade research (Cahillane & Anderson, 2021). The UDA model decay curves predict retention out to 12 months. As the CRA-T extant retention levels are based on the UDA model, the CRA-T does not predict retention beyond 12 months. However, the CRA-T still has utility if the intent is to understand which task elements/KLPs and subtasks/EOs would be most and least prone to fade. If the ambition is to extend a refresher training interval to beyond 12 months, then performance data would need to be collected and analysed."

    "content": "The current scientific literature, alongside defence case studies (Cahillane et al., 2020), provided the basis for the revised taxonomy of psychological knowledge and skill domains in Figure 9. It was developed due to concerns that the original may not reflect the knowledge and skills considered important by Defence today and in the future, given emerging roles (MacLean et al., 2015; Richards & Deighton, 2019). The re- classification of KSA in terms of the psychological knowledge and skill domains outlines knowledge, skills and attitudes in a manner that is consistent with advances in the psychological literature on human cognition (Green & Bavelier, 2015; Sanli & Carnaham, 2018; Stasielowicz, 2019). There are no attitudinal domains because attitudes do not decay over time. Nevertheless, there is a relationship between attitudes and skills retention, hence the taxonomy’s acknowledgement of Attitudes. Figure 9 – Revised Taxonomy of Psychological Knowledge and Skills Domains Understanding the retention of knowledge and skills is important to Defence because it is known that knowledge and skills are retained at different rates over time. Understanding the rate at which different types of knowledge and skills fade can inform training design and delivery decisions."

    "section": "A Revised Taxonomy of Psychological Knowledge and Skill Domains",
    "content": "Knowledge is organised into that which is explicit (knowing ‘what) and implicit (knowing ‘how’). Explicit knowledge refers to basic facts and principles, for example, safety regulations, including any procedures to be followed. Implicit knowledge refers to tacit (non-declarative), unconscious knowledge about ‘doing’. For example, when faced with complex situations, firefighters and incident commanders do not consciously articulate the knowledge they are using because it is implicit. Based on their experience, they automatically recognise salient situational cues which match a course of action. However, research shows that when prompted after an incident, firefighters and incident commanders can describe what they were thinking. The psychological skills domains are organised into Physical, Simple Cognitive, and Complex Cognitive categories. In terms of the Physical category, the Continuous Psychomotor skills domain refers to the ability to perform motor actions that do not have distinct beginnings or ends (for example driving or flying and manoeuvring an aircraft. Performing well trained sequences of motor actions with discrete beginnings and endings reflects discrete psychomotor skills, such as performing weapon handling drills. The Cognitive categories refer to mental skills and distinguish between simple and complex cognitive skills. Simple cognitive skills include the Procedural skills domain, which represents the ability to remember a sequence of steps and their order to execute a task. There are minimal physical demands. For example, when using a BIMS to create map overlays, the physical component only constitutes using a mouse and the procedural aspect dominates. This distinguishes procedural skills from discrete psychomotor skills such as weapon handling, which have greater physical demands and require the recall of a sequence of actions. Simple Decision-making involves a series of processes involving analysis and evaluation with discrete outputs that have a definite beginning and end and result in a decision. The options available during a simple decision- making process are usually binary, such as 'Yes' and ‘No’ when a decision tree is followed, for example, combat casualty drills."

    "section": "A Revised Taxonomy of Psychological Knowledge and Skill Domains",
    "content": "Complex cognitive skills include the Complex Decision-making, Adaptive Cognition and the Integrative domains. Complex decision-making involves an iteration of situational assessment, analysis and evaluation cycles that continue until an optimal decision is reached. Examples include carrying out an intelligence estimate or threat analysis and assessment. Adaptive Cognition reflects the ability to constantly monitor the discrepancies between the current and desired state and adapt behaviour to meet the demands of a new situation where the context changes. Problem-solving tasks represent an example where the ability to identify desired goal states (i.e., the need for a solution) and to apply and/or adapt existing strategies (derived from knowledge and experience) are required to arrive at a solution. The example of the US Airways Flight 1549 Hudson River plane crash provides an illustration of the use of adaptive cognition. The pilot, ‘Sully’ had to consider all of the conceptual components of the landing task and their relationships within a new context and adapt his existing learnt strategies to successfully land the plane in the Hudson River."

    "section": "A Revised Taxonomy of Psychological Knowledge and Skill Domains",
    "content": "The Integrative domain is a complex cognitive (i.e., mental) ‘meta-skill’. It sits above the other skill domains and represents the ability of an individual to manage their attention in order to perform within two or more different psychological skill domains concurrently. The Integrative domain is required for subtasks where the task elements match a combination of two or more different psychological skill domains that are performed concurrently (i.e., integrated). An example is a firefighter responsible for responding to an incident (simple decision-making) and deciding what and how information should be communicated to multiple agencies (complex decision-making), whilst managing events immediate to the scene of a fire (procedural skills). Note that the procedural skills and discrete psychomotor skills cannot be integrated (i.e., performed concurrently). This because discrete psychomotor skills involve the recall of a sequence of motor actions. Hence, higher motor demands are combined with moderate cognitive demands (i.e., procedural skill). An example of two simple cognitive skills that might be performed concurrently (i.e., integrated) are continuous psychomotor and adaptive cognition, for example, a UAS pilot having to adapt their thinking in order to drive behavioural, i.e., continuous psychomotor output. The UAS pilot has to adapt to constant changes in the information being fed back to them by the sensors, which they are simultaneously controlling. Although a high-level distinction between mental and physical skills is provided in JSP 822 Part 2 (2021), it does not define different types of mental skills that are consistent with advances in the psychological literature (e.g., simple and complex cognitive skills). The accurate consideration of competence acquisition and retention is constrained as a result. However, JSP 822 acknowledges the CRA-T as a process specifically designed to facilitate the retention of knowledge and skills. Based on the original CRA-T, Annex B to JSP 822 Part 2 provides definitions of the psychological knowledge and skill domains and illustrates the effect of task frequency on their retention. A summary of practical training ‘strategies’ are also presented."

    "content": "The rate at which a skill decays is moderated by the type of skill involved (e.g., Cahillane et al., 2013; Cahillane et al., 2020; Richards & Deighton, 2019). Simple cognitive skills (procedural and simple decision-making) are known decay rapidly (e.g., Cahillane, MacLean & Smy, 2018; Cahillane & Morin, 2012). The rapid rate of decay observed for simple cognitive skills is explained by the fact that they have a combination of low physical demands and moderate cognitive (i.e., mental) demands. The moderate cognitive demand relates to the need to recall cognitive processes or explicit information. Retention is improved where the physical demand is higher. Skills are retained better when they require a combination of moderate to high physical demands and moderate cognitive demands, for example, discrete psychomotor skills such as weapon handling drills. These types of skills require rote memory for cognitive stepped processes and procedures, and their rehearsal to aid their acquisition and retention. Complex cognitive skills (complex decision-making and adaptive cognition) are also better retained than simple cognitive skills (Villado et al., 2013). Complex cognitive skills place much higher demands on cognition, irrespective of physical demand. The higher cognitive demands account for the reduced skill fade found to date for complex cognitive skills. To date, only one study (Sanli & Carnahan, 2018) has considered the retention rate of complex cognitive skills and reported retention up to 6 months after initial training. Hence, there is currently insufficient evidence to define retention levels for complex cognitive skills."

    "content": "These task cases were down-selected in consultation with the Dstl as being representative of current and future Defence and Security skills. For each task, the revised taxonomy was applied at the subtask level of analysis to capture the psychological domains underpinning the subtask elements. Frequency counts for each psychological domain demonstrated the proportion of the domains involved in each task. For each task, the UDA model was applied at the whole task level. The weighted values associated with the selected responses to the ten questions from the UDA were summed producing a total UDA score. This was then fed into the UDA formula to generate a predictive retention curve out to 52 weeks (i.e., 12 months). Questions addressing additional moderators of skills retention (e.g., training and context-related) were also applied. However, responses to these only suggested how the retention rate predicted by the UDA may be improved given a lack of longitudinal empirical data and weighted values for the combined effects of these additional factors. There was evidence of complex cognitive skills underpinning all the Defence and Security tasks examined. Furthermore, multiple psychological domains were found to underpin current and future tasks and this reflected either a combination of skills or an integration of interdependent skills. Where the Integrative domain was identified, this reflected that two or more coordinated skill domains were integrated (i.e., performed concurrently). These findings highlighted gaps in the UDA and CRA-T models. A full description of the findings for all five task cases is provided in the HS1.004 Skill Fade Phase 1 Technical Report (Cahillane et al., 2020)."

    "content": "Application of the UDA to the Royal Air Force (RAF) Firefighter task, ‘Incident Commander – Respond to an Incident’ resulted in no decay curve (UDA Total score 66.) Understanding the psychological domains that underpin this task provides an explanation for the lack of a curve. The pie chart in Figure 10 displays the proportion of the underlying psychological skill domains involved in performance of this task as a whole. 75% of the task involves complex cognitive skills. The remaining 25% draws on the Simple Decision-making domain, a simple cognitive skill relying on memory for discrete stepped processes. Figure 10 – Psychological domains underpinning RAF Firefighter role: ‘Incident Commander – Respond to an incident’. (Note: D-M = Decision-Making) SMEs perceived that the subtasks were underpinned by both explicit and implicit knowledge, with the latter being more complex. A probable explanation for this is that Incident Commanders make rapid intuitive decisions when faced with complex situations based upon patterns in associative memory (Klein, 1999). At the time, they do not consciously articulate the knowledge they are using and therefore it is implicit. However, research shows that when prompted after the incident, incident commanders can articulate their implicit knowledge."

    "content": "Rather than being determined by working memory capacity, the science indicates that the retention of complex cognitive skills and implicit knowledge is enhanced by the development of a mental model; in this case, patterns of incidents and cognitive (i.e., mental) responses stored in associative memory. The UDA, which underpins CRA’s retention levels (i.e., green, amber, and red) and corresponding retention level definitions, only considers working memory capacity for discrete stepped processes and procedures. Therefore, the UDA is only valid for physical skills (i.e., the Continuous Psychomotor and Discrete Psychomotor domains), simple cognitive skills (i.e., the Simple Decision-making and Procedural domains) and the Explicit Knowledge domain."

    "section": "Simple vs. Complex Tasks",
    "content": "‘Simple’ tasks are underpinned by physical and/or simple cognitive skills and involve discrete subtasks/EOs that are performed separately. Such discrete subtasks/EOs can be performed in isolation from each other and there are no conceptual relationships between them. For example, weapon handling involves the Discrete Psychomotor domain. This underpins the ability to perform well trained sequences of motor actions with discrete beginnings and endings. These motor actions refer to the weapon handling drills. Explicit knowledge also underpins this task, as it does all tasks. As tasks become more complex, the psychological domains involved become more complex and they involve either combinations and/or an integration of psychological domains. Furthermore, resea rch indicates that task complexity and the combination of cognitive and physical demands are associated with the rate of skill decay (Wang et al., 2013). Therefore, to understand and manage the retention of complex tasks, tasks should not be thought of in a single psychological domain. Instead, they should be considered as involving a combination and/or integration of domains. Integration is understood by looking at the whole task. Some complex tasks can be partially integrated whereas other can be fully integrated. This is important to understand because the Integrative domain is used to control and coordinate the other psychological skill domains at the task element/KLP level. This provides the ‘glue’ that holds these elements together (Cahillane et al., 2020). If a task is fully integrated (all subtasks are underpinned by the integrative domain), then it should be practised and assessed at the whole task level. This ensures the integrative ‘glue’, essential for effective task completion, is addressed in the design of the training. If, however, a task is only partially integrated (some but not all of the subtasks are underpinned by the integrative domain), then it may be possible for some subtasks to be practised and assessed at the part task level."

Within this model sits the acquisition process of CADMID 15 and CADMIT 16 , which each Defence Line of Development (DLOD)17, including Training18, has to work within. Figure 3 describes how the training elements of capability fit within the CADMID/T lifecycle and what processes and outputs, including DSAT documentation, are required: FINMILCAP Processes. These financial planning processes ensure that pan- DLOD capabilities meet genuine needs, are affordable and compliant with Defence and SC policies and strategies. The cost of developing and delivering individual and collective training for new capabilities, as well as for updates and upgrades to existing, will be assured through the activities of the Personnel and Training DLODs engaging with capability sponsors and DE&S/ISS project teams. This includes developing through-life personnel and training costs within capability planning options, project initial and main gate business case cost models and project/in- service Procurement (P9) and Support (S9) funding lines19. Concepts & Doctrine Processes. Concept and doctrine documentation such as Concepts of Employment (CONEMP), Concepts of Use (CONUSE) and operational doctrine are integral parts of developing and delivering the right capabilities. Again, Personnel and Training DLODs must be considered in all these documents as they underpin the development of subsequent requirements documents. These concepts will be based on Defence and SCs’ policies and strategies for training."

The governance, management, and assurance (Element 4) of training are collectively known as an MTS. An MTS is an iterative mechanism (supported by documented products and processes) to ensure that the training being delivered remains meaningful and continues to contribute to delivering Defence effect. When delivered correctly, the outputs of the DSAT Elements, combined with the MTS, deliver a Training System that meets the required QMS. For the MTS to be effective, bodies such as boards and working groups must be established to ensure that the DSAT process remains on track and the Training System remains appropriate to the need. Key DSAT documentation (explained later in this Section) must also be produced. As an integral part of the MTS, activities that directly contribute to meeting the QMS are also embedded within each Element. The MTS mostly draws in products from the DSAT process in order to record and demonstrate that the QMS is being met and avoid duplication. All stakeholders in the Training System will have some involvement in the MTS."

    "section": "What is a Training System?",
    "content": "Figure 4: The DSAT Process Generating a Training System Defence requires its people to place themselves in harm’s way to deliver Defence effect. Defence people work in hazardous environments, under stressful conditions whilst conducting activities that carry a high risk to personal safety. Consequently, Defence must ensure that its Training Systems meet the very highest standards. Training must also be robust, realistic, and challenging if it is to prepare its personnel for the full spectrum of Defence Roles. However, there is a tendency, because of the risk, for Defence training organisations to provide more training than necessary in the misguided belief that this will make up for future uncertainties. And, in some cases, poorly designed or executed Training Systems can deliver insufficient training. The ideal then is a Training System that is designed to train its personnel to an optimal level so that they are equipped with the appropriate Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes (KSA). Providing too much training costs money that will likely be taken from elsewhere in the training budget that could then result in insufficient training in other areas, which risks lives. Therefore, a Training System designed using a common process and that is governed and managed in accordance with the Defence mandated QMS, is vital to ensure that Defence people are best equipped to achieve Defence effect."

The Safe System of Training (SST) does not replace Health and Safety legislation, nor the guidance offered by the Health and Safety Executive; rather, the SST should be read in conjunction with JSP375. The SST is derived from the Safe System of Work (SSW) and sets the conditions under which Defence training is to be conducted, ensuring personnel are provided with the appropriate information, instruction, and supervision. This enables Defence to meet the training imperative set by the Operational Requirement, whilst ensuring that personnel given the best possible preparation for the roles they may undertake. The SST enables Defence to maintain training risks at As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) by ensuring those who conduct the training are competent and that all risks, and associated mitigation measures have been considered. Further direction and guidance on SST policy is being developed and will be published as soon as practical. The SST differs from the SSoW as those undergoing training cannot be deemed competent until they have successfully completed training and have undertaken any required assessments, achieved qualifications, and have obtained the currency and experience24 to perform their duties. The SST is important as training units carry additional risk as many of their people, including staff, have not yet reached a specified level of competence. Commanders and Managers have the additional responsibility to ensure those in their charge can deliver and train safely. Training supervisors and deliverers must ensure that the training risks are recognised, communicated, and mitigated, and in conjunction with those in support of training, dynamically alter training as necessary. The SST sets the conditions under which training is to be conducted, ensuring those undergoing training are given appropriate information, instruction, and supervision. The levels of supervision and competency required of those delivering and supervising training will be directed by the relevant Training Authority."

    "content": "There are well established processes (JSP 375) and (JSP 892) for determining and assessing risks in place. In addition to Health and Safety requirements set out in (JSP 375). There is also a requirement for the Commanders Risk Assessment (CRA) pertaining to the care and welfare of trainees (Further information on the CRA can be found in volume 4). Risk/assumption management must start at the beginning of the DSAT process26. Risks/assumptions are to be held on risk/assumption registers at all levels (e.g. training establishment, SC or SC’s subordinate training HQ) and are to be managed iaw relevant Defence risk management policies. Risks/assumptions must be reviewed regularly during all Elements of the DSAT process and updated with any new and emerging risks. Training should be delivered as it was planned, with the correct training facilities, suitably qualified and experienced training staff and with the correct procedures and instructions. Undue pressure should not be put on managers or those delivering training to deviate from planned and endorsed training programmes. Those responsible for the management and delivery of training should have the ability to amend training as necessary, to meet changing environmental conditions (e.g. avoiding excessive heat), equipment deficiencies or shortfalls in resources. However, careful consideration must be given to the resultant risk, especially where it has an impact on safety that increases the risk to life and could result in death or serious injury. It is imperative that the delivery of training remains progressive and subject to a safe system of training throughout. Changes to planned training delivery such as truncating, accelerating or other variations (changing location, time, or content etc) can affect the rate at which training proficiency is achieved, potentially increasing the associated risk. In many cases certain proficiency criteria must be met by trainees to be able to perform tasks in a consistent, reliable, and repeatable manner that meets established standards, facilitating the progression in training and enabling post training activities. This is of paramount importance for any critical training which, if not conducted to the correct standard, increases the risk to life and could result in death or serious injury. Any change to the content, time, or resources available for such critical training must be subject to an approved risk assessment by the Commander, Line Manager or accountable person."

This may occur within a training day or training course as activities are changed and amended, with the trainer or supervisor required to keep track of the impact on safety as well as the training standard and welfare of all those involved. Cumulative risk incorporates other areas such as support and management, where there is no longer the capacity to maintain the existing training or update it to meet changing requirements (e.g. input standards) or fully implement the recommendations from reviews. For example, the informal act of a changing task (change in task complexity, omitting a particular step, changing the conditions set out in the planned activity) - although necessary, may have introduced additional risks that were not recognised- either in facilitating training, or in the need for suitable progression for the trainees. In addition, gapping in the training support area may mean this change is never updated in the DSAT mandated documentation and hence it is not reviewed and authorised. Operational pressures and resource constraints may then mean this shortfall is continually repeated in several areas and informal changes become normalised: the training delivered may be required but does not match the authorised and documented instructions and procedures being managed and resourced. Such cumulative risk must be recognised, escalated through the chain of command, and actioned as necessary."

Fidelity can be defined as, ‘the exact correspondence with fact or with a given quality, condition, or event; accuracy (e.g. the fidelity of the movie to the book or the degree to which an electronic system accurately reproduces the sound or image of its input signal)’.  This analysis should be conducted as a result of the production of a Role PS and/or Framework(s) derived from the RA, and include any existing Training Performance Standards. Fidelity Analysis considers each relevant Performance objective in the Role PS and/or Framework(s) to assess the extent to which the training environment should replicate the workplace (real) environment to enable training to be effective. Location/Environment implications – 1.6.2.  The training environment and implications of location may well impact on the suitability of different training solutions. For example expensive or scarce training resources including simulators, real equipment or specialist instructors may only be available in some locations.  It is therefore important to determine an estimate of where the balance between training to be delivered in a training establishment and workplace training will fall. Methods & Media options – 1.6.3.  The training Methods and Media options selected will depend upon the type of training, training policy, training throughput and good practice.  An assessment is required of the relative training effectiveness of each Method and Media option to bridge the training gaps (as determined in 1.4.1), based upon the TGA of each option and the Defence need."

    "content": "Cost Benefits Analysis (CBA) – 1.6.4.  It is important that costing and investment appraisal are undertaken strictly in accordance with the current Defence or TLB policies and conventions.  If training specialists become involved with costing or investment appraisal, they should obtain current advice from the TNASG or other authoritative body.  CBA activity does not start at this stage of the TNA but the result of it is included in the Training Needs Report hence its inclusion here.  Like many aspects of DSAT, CBA is an iterative process with initial activity commencing much earlier in the TNA process, as appropriate.  The CBA will likely be further refined during the Method & Media selection process in Element 2 (Design, Stage 2, 2.5).  An estimate of the financial risks and/or opportunities associated with each training solution option should be undertaken and will be a significant factor in selecting training solution options.  Training analysts are unlikely to be qualified to conduct financial risk analysis at anything other than a superficial level and should therefore seek specialist advice and support. Options Evaluation – 1.6.5.  The final activity of the TNA is to decide on training options.  To evaluate the merits of the training options (determined at 1.6.2A) one of them should be selected as a baseline.  The selection of a baseline will depend on the context, which then permits the construction of a table to display the relative merits of each option against the baseline.  Options can be assessed via several criteria: The extent to which the option meets the requirements."

Assessment requires the trainer to determine whether learning has occurred which requires making a judgement on trainee Performance and progress, then to decide whether the trainee is sufficiently competent in a particular Role or Task to be qualified for employment and/or work with or without supervision.  The proper conduct of assessment in training can have a major impact on training time and resources, but ultimately will contribute directly to Defence outputs.  Trainers should be able to administer assessments in training in a fair, valid and reliable manner in accordance with the AStrat and ASpecs.  This is achieved through the use of an up-to-date ASpec when planning an assessment; assessing all of the EOs and KLPs as specified in the ASpec and not make any changes that alter these; as well as the standardisation of conduct and moderation of marking:",

If an assessment is conducted using the same instructions every time, all trainees should receive exactly the same assessment, regardless of when, where and by whom the assessment is conducted.

For example, by having a proportion of assessments marked for a second time by a different trainer without first seeing the original score or grades awarded; the resulting scores are then compared for consistency.  Where scores do not agree, trainers should consult with other trainers, and as a team, identify where the problem may lie. Any problems with the marking criteria should be highlighted to the DTS, DTM or Chain of Command."

    "section": "Purpose and Application.  The purpose of Robust Training is to progressively develop a Service Person’s (SPs) resilience to enable them to perform effectively in any operational environment.  The degree to which Robust Training is employed within an Initial training programme should reflect the employment of that SP in both specialist and generic tasks.  Emphasis should be placed upon the need for SP to perform in the most demanding conditions in which they may realistically expect to find themselves if deployed to high-tempo and/or high-threat operational environments.  As Defence transitions to a contingent posture, the non-linear nature of the Contemporary Operating Environment (COE) will inevitably expose SP from support functions to higher risks than would have traditionally been the case.  It is therefore no longer acceptable to have a situation where combat personnel and support or service support personnel sit at distant ends of a wide spectrum of individual resilience.  This gap should be narrowed if all SP are to be best prepared for operational service.  This requires moral courage to implement and there is a need for a coherence of approach across Defence and single Service (sS) training establishments to ensure that Robust Training is systematic, progressive and appropriately contextualised.",

As Defence returns to contingency the certainty of future operational environments and the threats that emerge may be less defined and less clearly understood.  This uncertainty requires a refinement within training if we are to produce a new generation of robust, self-sufficient and capable SP. Contextualised.  sS training needs to provide ‘immersive’ scenarios to allow recruits and trainees to contextualise their training.  It is necessary to replicate the physical and mental pressures of operations that are specific to Service and role, noting the need to ensure that supporting personnel should also build resilience through Robust Training.  If all SP are to be best prepared for operational service, training needs to focus on the increased resilience end of the spectrum and where possible enhance the psychological stressors in training (e.g. increased use of battle simulation, additional night training scenarios) and the physical stressors (e.g. extending training days, more time living ‘in the field’ or austere simulated operational conditions). Delivered to defined standards.  The ability to measure how successfully sS deliver training that challenges a recruit or trainee to develop physical and mental resilience should be achieved via measures of performance whilst in Initial training, and through measures of effect once SP join their respective Commands.  Detailed assessment through both InVal and ExVal will be essential in determining the degree to which Robust Training is succeeding."

    "content": "Delivered with calculated risk.  The acceptance of risk is important, and its application must be understood at all levels of training delivery.  It must be proportionate to the delivery of the defined operational output.  There is both a moral obligation to prepare recruits and trainees appropriately for the rigours of operational Service, and a need to recognise that a Robust Training regime may lead to injury, increased wastage rates or litigation.  These factors are not mutually opposing or irreconcilable.  Robust Training can be delivered during all phases of training whilst successfully discharging Defence’s welfare and Duty of Care responsibilities.  The risks associated with Robust Training must be identified, assessed and addressed with a view to enabling this important element of training.  A culture of risk aversion must be avoided as it merely transfers risk to the Commands and is morally unjustifiable.  It is incumbent upon Commanders, their staff and trainers to be conversant with the principles and application of risk assessment at their respective levels of training command.  Intelligent risk management must be led by the Commander and understood by all staff involved in training delivery.  The first step in developing risk management locally will be through the CRA/SCD process.  Detailed briefing on local procedures must be included in staff/trainer induction training and understanding must be developed further through regular study periods Appropriate supervision.  The level and style of supervision needs to be tailored to the level of risk, the type of training and the ability and confidence of the recruits or trainees. Trust in the Chain of Command.  The application of Robust Training may be compromised, at least in part, by a mutual lack of trust between training staff and their Chains of Command.  This can be compounded by a perception amongst trainers that there has been a shift in emphasis to the recruit’s or trainee’s care needs that conflict with challenging, engaging and robust training.  Recruits and trainees must be empowered to ask questions and appropriately challenge the ‘recruiting promise.’  This should not, however, be viewed as a challenge to the core tenets of sS Values, Standards and Ethos, or the Chain of Command.  Trust needs to be established early so that there is an understanding of what is required and the rationale behind Robust Training."

    "content": "Capability is not just a function of equipment performance, but depends on a combination of interacting elements. Some of the most difficult issues to address lie in the Human Component of Capability. The equipment and systems have to be operated in a demanding and diverse military context in circumstances of fatigue, hunger, stress and even fear. Ultimately their usability in these demanding environments will determine our operational success. The types of equipment and systems we are now specifying and procuring will also shape the roles, responsibilities and career paths of future service personnel who we recruit, and our ability to retain them. Approaching our Defence needs from a capability direction, rather than a platform, system or equipment one, heightens the need for Human Factors Integration (HFI) of Defence systems. We must set out to deliver solutions that enhance our capability aspirations with a more sophisticated understanding of the role of people in the operation, maintenance and support of our future systems. The challenge is to integrate the people provided by the Armed Forces (including Reservists), with the equipment developed by industry and delivered by the Ministry of Defence, in a way that maximises capability within the real operational environment. Joint Service Publication 912 promulgates the policy requirements and comprehensive practical guidance for undertaking HFI. This Part 1 of JSP 912 provides the direction that is mandated by Defence, and is sponsored by the Defence Authority for Technical and Quality Assurance. It provides policy-compliant business practices that should be adopted in the absence of any contradicting instruction."

    "content": "The terms ‘Human Factors (HF)’, ‘Human Factors Engineering (HFE)’ and ‘Human Factors Integration’ are often confused. ‘Human Factors’ refers to a range of disciplines (principally scientific), which relate to the study of human capabilities, limitations, characteristics and behaviour in the broadest possible sense. It includes the study of human interactions with technologies and social interactions and draws on many scientific disciplines, including ergonomics, psychology (and neuropsychology), physiology, biology, anthropometry and biomechanics. It provides the knowledge base from which Human Factors Engineering draws. HFE is concerned with the application of this knowledge in the design, development, assessment, fielding, in-service support and disposal of products – equipment, sub-systems, systems and platforms. In contrast, HFI is a management activity, which includes a systematic process for identifying, tracking and resolving people-related considerations (especially risks and issues), to ensure a balanced development of both technological and human aspects of capability. It is imperative to understand that HFI is more than HFE. It comprises the following five domains: Personnel."
