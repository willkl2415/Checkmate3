    "content": "The user may wish, as a result of the RA (particularly the KSA Analysis), to consider the production of either a competence framework or competency framework, or both; either in addition to, or instead of, a Role PS. This could be done if a people focus, rather than pure task focus, is required.\nCompetency & Competence. The human element of operational capability is a complex area to analyse. It is, however, important to understand both the people and training aspects, as different methodologies of analysis fit different needs, and, within the Defence context, they are sometimes confused. The relationship between competency, competence and performance needs to be understood in a consistent manner:\nCompetency (plural: competencies) is the underlying characteristic(s) of an individual which results in effective and/or superior performance within a Role. OJAR/SJAR is an example of an organisational level competency framework that is common to all Service personnel. Professional competency frameworks can also be used in order to provide guidance to defined professional groups, such as the Royal Navy\u2019s Command Competency Framework, where there is a need for longer term individual professional development and/or selection."

CRA is intended to assist Defence to reduce the impact of skill fade and enhance competence retention. It is relevant to two audiences as follows:\nTraining analysts can use the outputs of CRA during the Training Needs Analysis (TNA) process to justify training solutions and the training budget; and"

This analysis also enables the impact upon Defence capability to be assessed if the new or changed Defence capability is implemented without additional training. The TGA should provide:\nan update of the information contained in the Scoping Exercise Report and RA (if required)."

This should be presented as statements for each task, identifying additional workplace and unit training requirements with a statement of any associated penalties regarding reduction in capability. If the option to continue existing training with existing resources is an acceptable risk for all Role PS identified in the RA, then the TNA is complete and a TOA may not be required.\nWhilst the TNA is designed to look at the gap that cannot be delivered by existing training, it should also consider the resource implications on existing training activities and the ability of those Training Providers to deliver in respect of a change in training throughput."
