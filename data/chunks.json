Individual Training is training designed to develop a mix of Knowledge, Skills, Experience and Behaviours (KSE-B) of individuals.  It takes place in any environment, conforms to a Defence Systems Approach to Training (DSAT) generated Training System, has suitable training governance processes in place, and can utilise a variety of Methods & Media."

DSAT is designed to generate a Training System that empowers trainers to deliver safe, risk-focused, appropriate, effective, efficient and accountable training to trainees and training audiences. If training is a factor, identified through the DLOD, then the requirement for new or amended training must be examined thus starting the DSAT process with Element 1 – Analysis. Following an initial analysis, if training is required then the DSAT process continues, and once a full analysis is completed the training is then designed (Element 2), delivered (Element 3) and assured (Element 4) consequently creating a Training System. Integral to the 4 Elements of analysis, design, delivery and assurance is the need to ensure that the DSAT process and the resultant Training System is properly managed and governed and meets the high standards required for training in Defence.  The management, governance and assurance of training are collectively known as a Management of Training System (MTS)."

    "content": "The outputs of the DSAT Elements, combined with the correct implementation of the MTS, delivers a Training System that meets the required Quality Management Standard (QMS).   For the MTS to be effective, bodies such as boards and working groups must be established to ensure that the DSAT process remains on track and the Training System remains appropriate to the need. As an integral part of the MTS, activities that directly contribute to meeting the QMS are also embedded within each Element.  The MTS mostly draws in products from the DSAT process (to avoid duplication) in order to record and demonstrate that the QMS is being met.  All stakeholders of the Training System will have some involvement in the MTS. Where, for organisational, contractual, or other reasons, activities are distributed and/or responsibilities delegated other than as recommended, then this should be agreed at the CEB and annotated on the TrAD.  In all cases, any variance from the MTS must still be DSAT QMS compliant and auditable."

The TRA is responsible for the evaluation of the effect of the training in achieving the Role PS and/or Framework(s) wherever the training is delivered.  The TRA often sits at the Service Command (SC) level and sets the requirement for a new training activity, or a variation to an existing one, as well as some aspects of the assurance of the training. The TRA is often a nominated post at 2* level but it is common practice for TRA responsibilities to be delegated, by letter, to an individual (or organisation) who has more knowledge of the specific requirement."

The DSAT process allows training specialists to adopt a structured, methodical approach to the analysis of the T-DLOD need, or requirement.  It sets out the various activities, collectively termed the TNA, which may be used in order to conduct a TNA, which informs subsequent Elements and forms part of the overall Training System. TNA.  A TNA is a structured analysis of training need arising as a result of new equipment acquisition, doctrinal change, organisational change, or changes to policy/legislation It is a highly flexible procedure with the choice of supporting tools and techniques to suit different Training Systems. It typically includes an analysis of different training Methods and technologies, with a view to recommending the optimum training solution to meet Defence needs and which balances cost and quality.   In all cases, however, a TNA is an output based, iterative process that provides an audit trail for all decisions and is closely mapped to the requirements of the QMS.  A TNA does not, and should not, imply that training will be the only solution.  If training is not the solution, this will become apparent in the Planning Stage, after which, analysis activity will cease. It should be noted that a TNA may range from a simple interview to a process lasting several months."

The need to design training from scratch on a ‘blank sheet of paper’ is a very unusual occurrence, as it is much more likely that existing training can be modified.  It follows, therefore that it is often desirable to analyse the current training first.  Where current role information, Role PS, Framework(s) or Training Objectives (TOs) do not exist for any current training, more comprehensive Role Analysis (RA), may be required, before any determination of a training requirement can be made.  Analysis of similar, existing, training is also useful to support this.

It is therefore important to determine an estimate of where the balance between training to be delivered in a training establishment and workplace training will fall. Methods & Media options – 1.6.3.  The training Methods and Media options selected will depend upon the type of training, training policy, training throughput and good practice.  An assessment is required of the relative training effectiveness of each Method and Media option to bridge the training gaps (as determined in 1.4.1), based upon the TGA of each option and the Defence need. Cost Benefits Analysis (CBA) – 1.6.4.  It is important that costing and investment appraisal are undertaken strictly in accordance with the current Defence or TLB policies and conventions.  If training specialists become involved with costing or investment appraisal, they should obtain current advice from the TNASG or other authoritative body.  CBA activity does not start at this stage of the TNA but the result of it is included in the Training Needs Report hence its inclusion here.

An estimate of the financial risks and/or opportunities associated with each training solution option should be undertaken and will be a significant factor in selecting training solution options.  Training analysts are unlikely to be qualified to conduct financial risk analysis at anything other than a superficial level and should therefore seek specialist advice and support."

Learning in the workplace is just as important as learning on a course and requires the support of qualified trainers.  Whether in the workplace or a training establishment, the underlying principles and standards for the delivery of Defence training remain the same. Training provision is the process conducted by the Training Provider that enables and allows trainees to learn.  It is the outputs that ensure trainers are trained, learning activities are piloted, programmed and resourced, learning is prepared for, training deficiencies are managed, risks are assessed, and trainees are appropriately cared for. It is expected that the Training Provider will take the lead on the DSAT activities, processes and outputs required to be completed during Element 3 (Delivery).

Changes to planned training delivery such as truncating, accelerating or other variations (changing location, time or content etc) can affect the rate at which training proficiency is achieved, potentially increasing the associated risk. In many cases certain proficiency criteria must be met by trainees to be able to perform tasks in a consistent, reliable and repeatable manner that meets established standards, facilitating the progression in training and enabling post training activities. This is of paramount importance for any critical training which, if not conducted to the correct standard, increases the risk to life and could result in death or serious injury. Any change to the content, time or resources available for such critical training must be subject to an approved risk assessment by the Commander, Line Manager or accountable person. Furthermore, for all training activities, dynamic risk assessments are to be conducted before or during activities in response to changing or unexpected conditions.  This will allow training to be paused, amended, or stopped as necessary. Where, for organisational, contractual, or other reasons, activities are distributed and/or responsibilities delegated other than as recommended, then this should be agreed at the CEB and annotated on the TrAD.  In all cases, any variance from the MTS must still be DSAT QMS compliant and auditable."

    "content": "Preparing training – 3.1.  Preparing training ensures that the Training Provider, and specifically the trainer, has completed preparation for the delivery of the lesson.  This includes the use of the LSpec and ASpec to generate lesson or event plans and assessments suitable to the training environment.  Consideration should also be given to the development of a remedial training strategy. The effectiveness of training delivery will be measured by the Training Provider and appropriate governance body according to whether the intended outcomes (the TOs) have been achieved successfully.  This is determined through the formal assessment process, but there will also be other, indirect outcomes of training (e.g. motivation to learn and creating independent learners) which will need to be considered when planning and preparing effective training.  These are not as easy to measure, but they are important if trainees are to perform to the best of their ability. Lesson / Event planning – 3.1.1.  Lesson/event planning is an essential part of the training delivery process.  A good lesson plan considers all the needs and expectations of the training audience (1.5.2), ensures risks have been considered and mitigation is in place to address them. Lesson/event plans must be based on the LSpec and take a learner-centric approach.  They are created by the trainer using the LSpec and a trainer should request support in developing their Lesson Plan should they need it. Assessment of learning – 3.1.2.  Assessment is an essential aspect of any training which must be properly understood and applied.  Assessment requires the trainer to determine whether learning has occurred which requires making a judgement on trainee Performance and progress, then to decide whether the trainee is sufficiently competent in a particular Role or Task to be qualified for employment and/or work with or without supervision.  The proper conduct of assessment in training can have a major impact on training time and resources, but ultimately will contribute directly to Defence outputs.  Trainers should be able to administer assessments in training in a fair, valid and reliable manner in accordance with the AStrat and ASpecs.  This is achieved through the use of an up-to-date ASpec when planning an assessment; assessing all of the EOs and KLPs as specified in the ASpec and not make any changes that alter these; as well as the standardisation of conduct and moderation of marking:"

If an assessment is conducted using the same instructions every time, all trainees should receive exactly the same assessment, regardless of when, where and by whom the assessment is conducted. Moderation.  Moderation of marking can help to ensure that the marking of assessments by different trainers is equitable and fair. For example, by having a proportion of assessments marked for a second time by a different trainer without first seeing the original score or grades awarded; the resulting scores are then compared for consistency.  Where scores do not agree, trainers should consult with other trainers, and as a team, identify where the problem may lie. Any problems with the marking criteria should be highlighted to the DTS, DTM or Chain of Command."

In larger Training Providers it is essential that trainers adhere to the programme as resources will need to be carefully managed to meet the needs of a high number of trainees on different training activities. Scheduling training – 3.3.  Once training activities are programmed the elements should be sequenced, or scheduled, in order that the training is conducted in the correct order to optimise both the acquisition and retention of the KSA.  This ensures that training is built up and TOs and their dependent EOs and KLPs are delivered in the order that maintains the integrity of their dependencies (i.e. that the achievement of a TO may require dependent EOs/KLPs to be conducted in a particular sequence in order to ensure that the trainees’ KSA is built up progressively).  This, however, may not always be necessary.  The course schedule or programme is usually produced by the Course Design Cell as part of the course documentation.  Particularly in larger training organisations, it is essential that trainers stick to the planned course programme. Where there is a need to change the course programme, this should always be approved by the course manager and trainers should aim to avoid short notice changes wherever possible. Resourcing training – 3.3.  Resourcing the training activity is intimately tied into its programming and scheduling.

Where risks or issues resulting from identified training deficiencies cannot be mitigated by the Training Provider, such training deficiency-based risks should be elevated for treatment or toleration etc.  Identifying and raising training deficiencies shows the stakeholders where training shortfalls exist or where risks have been taken owing to either an inability to train certain TOs (due to weather constraints or equipment casualties, for example) or a training failure that has been picked up through the assurance process.  Such deficiencies suggest that trainees may not hold the competences that the training should have delivered.  These are essentially unplanned but unavoidable training gaps which should therefore be captured, and the appropriate governance body informed so that a decision can be made to treat, tolerate or transfer (to the receiving unit) the training deficiency.

In response to report findings, the DTC was initiated in 2014. DTC professionalises the training cadre and through its robust governance and assurance processes ensures that all Defence trainers, trainer supervisors and training managers are suitably qualified and experienced. It outlines the requirement for a professional development pathway to continuously meet the required quality standard and competence and attracts externally recognised national qualifications.

Training is by necessity challenging – it has to transform civilians into professional Service personnel (SP) capable of operating in the harshest of global environments and pressured situations.  It must imbue SP with an attitude of responsibility, self-discipline and selflessness: fundamental components of military ethos that are essential to maintaining operational effectiveness.  The two principle components of initial training are to: ensure that recruits and trainees learn the skills and knowledge, appropriate to their trade/branch/specialism, so that they are suitably equipped and prepared to enter productive Service. inculcate the right attitudes in terms of military ethos, values and standards required of a SP and ensure that all recruits and trainees embrace the disciplinary, personal and communal standards that constitute that ethos."

There will be a number who, on occasion, fail to achieve the required benchmarks.  When a shortcoming is identified, necessary measures are taken to help and encourage the recruit or trainee to improve their performance.  The management of these measures is known as Remedial Training (RT).  The experience and judgement of trainers (be they military, civilian or contractors) remains fundamental to identifying the reasons for poor performance and determining appropriate remedial action. Training populations vary according to recruitment standards and the requirements of the Role PS and/or Framework(s).  Measures which would be appropriate for one population might be entirely inappropriate for another.  Additionally, in the early stages of training, recruits will be adjusting to military life and will take time to acquire the standards of behaviour expected of trainees in Phase 2 training. In accordance with JSP 833, measures must not contain any of the following: unreasonableness; public humiliation; sustained and oppressive treatment which amounts to or could reasonably be construed as harassment, including any form of bullying; sleep deprivation or deliberate infliction of pain; or work for any other benefit than that of the Service or individual’s rehabilitation."

It is inappropriate to instigate disciplinary procedures in dealing with continual deficiencies in knowledge, skills and physical fitness.

Equally, if the issue becomes serious (e.g. it amounts to discrimination, harassment or bullying), or if the recruit or trainee has already failed to respond to Tier 1 or 2 measures or is at the stage of training where they should know better, then disciplinary or administrative action may be more appropriate.

    "section": "Introduction",
    "content": "Properly conducted Robust Training is a basic principle of training in Defence and as such is linked to measurable Training Objectives (TOs) and outcomes.  It is deliberately designed to induce an element of pressure in order to challenge recruits and trainees mentally and physically, so that they draw on reserves of willpower and stamina to achieve the outcome sought.  The aim therefore of Robust Training events is to develop physical and mental resilience in order to prepare appropriately for the challenges of operations worldwide.  It is entirely practical to deliver such training without compromising welfare and Duty of Care responsibilities, but it must be regulated to prevent Robust Training being replaced with harsh or inappropriate training that prevents the overall training effect from being delivered. This Defence Direction assists Commanders involved in all phases of training, in planning appropriate and proportionate training that is challenging, engaging and robust, whilst ensuring that risks are identified and mitigated, so that the recruit or trainee is protected from uncontrolled misuse of the term to deliver harsh training, unlinked to a specified training outcome or objective.  Commanders should consider this Direction in conjunction with the ‘Commanders Managing the Training Environment’ Direction and the ‘Supervisory Care for Phase 1 Recruits and Phase 2 Trainees’ Direction and the Safe System of Training.  Both are contained within this JSP as are other policies relevant to ensuring a realistic and safe training environment.  In addition, all training should be designed and delivered in line with the Direction given in this JSP. Purpose and Application.  The purpose of Robust Training is to progressively develop a Service Person’s (SPs) resilience to enable them to perform effectively in any operational environment.  The degree to which Robust Training is employed within an Initial training programme should reflect the employment of that SP in both specialist and generic tasks.  Emphasis should be placed upon the need for SP to perform in the most demanding conditions in which they may realistically expect to find themselves if deployed to high-tempo and/or high-threat operational environments.  As Defence transitions to a contingent posture, the non-linear nature of the Contemporary Operating Environment (COE) will inevitably expose SP from support functions to higher risks than would have traditionally been the case.  It is therefore no longer acceptable to have a situation where combat personnel and support or service support personnel sit at distant ends of a wide spectrum of individual resilience.  This gap should be narrowed if all SP are to be best prepared for operational service.  This requires moral courage to implement and there is a need for a coherence of approach across Defence and single Service (sS) training establishments to ensure that Robust Training is systematic, progressive and appropriately contextualised."

Due to the wide range of training in Defence and the breadth of job specifications within both commissioned and non-commissioned ranks, what could be defined as Robust Training for one training cohort may not be suitable or appropriate for another.  While many operational conditions are similar for all, it is unlikely that any but the most generic of Robust Training events will be appropriate across Defence.  Robust Training must be designed to be relevant to the roles and duties of the recruit or trainee and likely employment on operations.  Robustness comes in many forms, both physical and mental.  sS and Defence training establishments need to implement a ‘continuum of robustness’ that threads through all phases of training, and which must be: Relevant.  sS training has spent the last decade or more delivering capability to defined operational theatres with (largely) understood threats.  As Defence returns to contingency the certainty of future operational environments and the threats that emerge may be less defined and less clearly understood.  This uncertainty requires a refinement within training if we are to produce a new generation of robust, self-sufficient and capable SP. Contextualised.  sS training needs to provide ‘immersive’ scenarios to allow recruits and trainees to contextualise their training.  It is necessary to replicate the physical and mental pressures of operations that are specific to Service and role, noting the need to ensure that supporting personnel should also build resilience through Robust Training.  If all SP are to be best prepared for operational service, training needs to focus on the increased resilience end of the spectrum and where possible enhance the psychological stressors in training (e.g. increased use of battle simulation, additional night training scenarios) and the physical stressors (e.g. extending training days, more time living ‘in the field’ or austere simulated operational conditions)."

The acceptance of risk is important, and its application must be understood at all levels of training delivery.  It must be proportionate to the delivery of the defined operational output.  There is both a moral obligation to prepare recruits and trainees appropriately for the rigours of operational Service, and a need to recognise that a Robust Training regime may lead to injury, increased wastage rates or litigation.  These factors are not mutually opposing or irreconcilable.  Robust Training can be delivered during all phases of training whilst successfully discharging Defence’s welfare and Duty of Care responsibilities.  The risks associated with Robust Training must be identified, assessed and addressed with a view to enabling this important element of training.

It is vital to avoid the inculcation of a culture of risk aversion that may lead to the physical or psychological inability to perform adequately when facing the challenge of operational conditions. Separated from remedial action.  It is important that training staff designing and delivering Robust Training must ensure that recruits and trainees as well as training staff understand the purpose and intended outcome of the training.  It must be clearly differentiated from any sort of remedial training, corrective or disciplinary action.  Training that is intended to be robust must not be confused with any form of bullying, harassment or intimidation.  Such conduct is wholly unacceptable and contrary to Defence’s Values, Standards and Ethos and the DHALI/B intent, and is demonstrably counter-productive in developing resilience.  Effective supervisory care, welfare policies and governance and assurance processes will ensure that Robust Training is not confused with, or replaced by, actions or events that either serve a different remedial, corrective or disciplinary purpose, or those that are conducted in a misguided attempt to achieve unsanctioned, unacceptable and unnecessary outcomes."

The conduct of Robust Training events must not undermine the good practice and culture of Continuous Improvement that is synonymous with DSAT and DHALI/B.  It is possible to prevent confusion amongst recruits and trainees by detailed explanation of Robust Training aims and objectives during induction and regularly thereafter.  Trainers must have the principles of Robust Training explained to them during their selection, training and again when they join the training establishment.  Where inexperienced staff or trainers are expected to apply Robust Training techniques they must be mentored and supervised."

    "content": "Ideally, Robust Training should not be confined to specific and stand-alone events; it must be all pervasive, coherent and progressive throughout all phases of training.  In its most basic form, Robust Training may simply be reflected through the setting of unremitting high standards by staff, trainers and support personnel. The following pressures could contribute to training being classified as robust.  The list is not intended to be prescriptive but, rather, provide examples.  Equally, the list is not exhaustive, and it must be read in conjunction with the points made above.  Some examples of Robust Training activity are at Table 8.  This list is intended to be illustrative rather than exhaustive: Psychological pressures."
