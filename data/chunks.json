    "content": "1. A TNA is a structured analysis of training need arising as a result of new equipment acquisition, doctrinal change, organisational change, or changes to policy/legislation. It generally includes an analysis of different training Methods and technologies, with a view to recommending the optimum training solution which balances cost and quality. It is a highly flexible procedure with the choice of supporting tools and techniques to suit different Training Systems. In all cases, however, a TNA is an output based, iterative process that provides an audit trail for all decisions and is closely mapped to the requirements of the QMS. A TNA does not, and should not, imply that training will be the only solution. If training is not the solution, this will become apparent in the Scoping Exercise, after which, analysis activity will cease."

The TOA considers each relevant Task in the Role PS / Competence Framework to assess the extent to which the training environment should replicate the workplace (real) environment to enable training to be effective. This is known as the Fidelity Analysis. The implications of locations and environment for training and Methods & Media options are then considered. The key outputs are the realistic options for Methods & Media and refinement (based upon fidelity, locations and environment) of the possible training solutions. Cost-effective options which take account of Whole Life training requirements (including refresher training) are considered.\n(5) Training Needs Report (TNR). The Training Needs Report analyses the cost benefits and then evaluates the merits of the training options, before confirming the TNASG endorsed training solution.

Before a TNA can begin, a clear evidence-based Statement of Requirement (SoR) is to be produced, preferably in a written format (letter, e-mail, request form or tasking order, for example). Then, prior to the commencement of the analysis, a scoping exercise is conducted which may identify that the most cost-effective means of achieving the required Defence need, is a training solution2. Once the requirement for training has been established, a TNA should be undertaken to ascertain the type and scope of the training requirement that meets the Defence need. It should be noted that a TNA may range from a simple interview to a process lasting several months. See DTSM 1 for more information on a SoR.\n4. Responsibility. It is expected that the Training Requirements Authority (TRA) will take the lead on the production of the DSAT activities, processes and outputs required to be completed during Element 1. The TRA may wish to delegate specific tasks, but will retain overall responsibility for them. The TRA will also be expected to ensure that those activities deemed critical to the development of the Training System are conducted. A key activity is the establishment of a TNA Steering Group (TNASG), upon receipt of a SOR, or other authority, to begin the TNA process. The TRA is ultimately responsible to the Customer for the work conducted during this Element. See DTSM 1 for more information on a TRA.\n2.1.2 Considerations with a TNA"

    "content": "9. Exploiting existing training activities. The need to design training from scratch on a  blank sheet of paper  is a very unusual occurrence, as it is much more likely that existing training can be modified. It follows, therefore that it is often desirable to analyse the current training first. Where current role information, Role PS / Framework(s) or TOs do not exist for any current training, more comprehensive RA may be required, before any determination of a training requirement can be made. Analysis of similar, existing, training is also useful to support this.\n10. Audit trail. A TNA should generate a clear audit trail which plots the sequence of events and decisions leading to a training solution. The justification and supporting evidence used as the basis for these decisions should be readily apparent (such as: references to, and/or copies of, academic research literature; the deliberations of the Analysts; minutes of TNASG meetings and Defence/Contractor publications). A quality audit trail requires full disclosure of, and rationale for, the methodology, tools and data sources used in the analysis, with copies of any specialist or bespoke software made available to the TNASG.\n11. Iterative/selective nature of TNAs. Whilst a TNA is carried out by completing a number of activities in sequence, it is important to note that the process is iterative in nature. Many influencing factors, risks and assumptions are liable to change during the conduct of a TNA. It is therefore important that at every stage of a TNA, the key outputs are reviewed to ensure their continuing validity, and that stages of the process be repeated if necessary. Processes for reviewing the TNA outputs should be capable of amendment where changes are required. Tight control should be exercised by the TNASG, which approves all changes to the TNA. Follow-on changes to the training requirement and the impact on training may be managed through a system of configuration control but this does not remove the responsibility of the TNASG for ensuring that changes are reflected in the TNA."

Constraints may also be identified in strategic trends, doctrine, concept documents (e.g. the Concept of Employment for a capability) or can be determined through contextual analysis (such as via PESTLE7 or other frameworks). They should also involve consideration of all the Defence Lines of Development (DLoDs)8. Key constraints include:\na. Policy. On occasion, Defence Policy will dictate the Methods and Media to be used. The TNA should adhere to the DTEL Rules9 and Defence Policy for Modelling & Simulation (M&S) (JSP 939), as well as taking account of policies on the use of the Support Solutions Envelope, Integrated Logistic Support 10 and Human Factors Integration for Defence Systems (JSP 912).

Therefore, it can be argued that jobs (in the traditional sense of a person conducting a single task requiring a single skill, for example) seldom exist. Accordingly, it is more appropriate to analyse a Role that a person will fulfil. An example would be a RN Catering Services rating, who is trained in the primary Role but routinely has other Roles and duties aboard ship that are not related to the primary role (such as firefighting and First Aid). Training that person for the job of Catering Services/Fire Fighter/First Aider is impractical, but training that person for the primary Role , then the Role of fire fighter and the First Aider makes more sense. Thus RA is a more logical term than Job Analysis and more reflective of what this analysis actually does."

An assessment of difficulty encountered in carrying out each task, the importance of each task to the achievement of the main job objective and the frequency with which tasks are performed, are key factors in making training decisions and priorities. DIF analysis is a useful technique which contributes to providing a rational basis for making decisions on the design of training which is superior to guesswork or intuition. However, other criteria may be used to decide upon levels of training; including numbers of service personnel performing the task, ease of training within the unit, how soon after training someone is expected to perform the task and how much time is spent performing the task."

These skills are learned in connection with common activities such as using a computer, driving a car or playing a musical instrument. Many tasks performed in Defence can be categorised as having a large physical component, e.g. stripping and assembling a weapon (discrete), flying an aircraft (continuous) and tying a bowline (discrete). Complex physical skills can often be broken down into smaller sub-skills, which can be learned separately and then put together for total performance. An example of this is swimming, which has 3 sub-skills (arm action, leg action and breathing technique), which can be learned and practised separately and then performed as one. More complex skills such as flying/driving, are similarly broken down into their component parts and taught as discrete skills in discrete lessons."

The identification of Standards relating to personal qualities and Attitudes is perhaps the most challenging part of the KSA Analysis. This is because Attitudes cannot always be observed directly and hence the creation of definable standards can prove difficult. Attitude is defined as a predisposition resulting in a tendency to act or react in a certain manner when confronted with another person, group, object, situation or idea. It is important to understand that this predisposition to think and feel in a certain way does not necessarily result in observable behaviours. An example of this could be an individual who holds an Attitude that all dogs are dangerous. However, this attitude may not be obvious to others when the individual is handling a dog with which they are familiar and have learned is friendly.

A Behaviourally Anchored Rating Scale (BARS) is an example of a tool which can be used to assess observable behaviour objectively. Although a BARS (Table 3) can be used to measure attitude indirectly through observing behaviour, much care is needed when inferring Attitudes from observable behaviours alone. Attitudes may also be directly measured using validated questionnaires or other psychometric instruments21. Some examples are presented in Table 3.

Detailed feedback stemming from a learner s performance, combined with a chance to improve performance, is important to skills acquisition.

Part- task training involves trainees learning and practising these task components in isolation. Once mastered the whole task should be practised.  This strategy is particularly beneficial for very\ncomplex tasks with cognitive (e.g. procedural) and psychomotor components.\nAppropriate simulation fidelity\n(e.g. continuous and discrete psychomotor, procedural, and decision-\nmaking skill types)\nWhen the acquisition of cognitive skills (procedural/decision making) is required, it is the psychological fidelity of a task and not its physical fidelity that drives skill acquisition and consolidation. However, where cognitive and psychomotor skills are combined high fidelity simulation helps the consolidation of skills.\nProcedural instructions\n(Procedural skill type)\nStructure instructions in a way that will induce learners to expend the cognitive effort needed for effective learning. Inclusion of more general steps helps learning transfer; they force the learner to try to understand the system or domain and engage in effortful cognitive strategies. Inclusion of examples with general instructions supports initial performance, because it helps the\nlearner understand what they needed to do.\nRefresher Assessment (e.g. discrete psychomotor, procedural and decision- making skill type)\nAssessment of core knowledge, skills and behaviours reduces the burden on refresher training. Training is only required for those task components where performance is below the required level of proficiency. This can exploit advances in new training technologies for the assessment of core knowledge, skills and behaviours at any point in time. Decision-making skills can be\nassessed using novel scenarios.\nStandardised and recorded assessment\n(Relevant to all knowledge and skill types)\nRecording trainee performance helps trainers in making objective assessments of learners  skill acquisition and in targeting the provision of feedback.\nMatch between training and operational environment\n(Relevant to all knowledge and skill types)\nRetention is enhanced if the training context and situational cues are similar to those which are experienced in the operational environment. Individuals should be exposed to as many different situations and content-based scenarios as possible to promote\nknowledge and skill transfer.\nOverlearning (overtraining) (e.g. discrete and\ncontinuous psychomotor, and procedural skill types)\nOverlearning refers to the continuation of practising a task after error free performance has been achieved. It can enhance speed of performance after accuracy has reached a ceiling. Effective for both psychomotor and cognitive skills, although any benefits provided are stronger for tasks with a cognitive element (e.g. memory for procedures).  Overlearning can benefit, e.g. the\nacquisition and retention of safety critical drills which can be proceduralised. It has little effect on long-term retention.\nVariable practice training (Relevant to all knowledge and skill types)\nVarying the practice of knowledge and different skills so that items are intermixed across the training programme rather than repeated in concentrated blocks; this enhances long term retention after extended periods of no practice. Acquisition can take less total time and the retention can be 50% better. The optimal inter study interval in distributed training protocols lies between 10-30% of the retention interval with longer inter-study intervals enhancing retention more than shorter inter-study interval.  A longer-than-optimal spacing is better than shorter-\nthan-optimal spacing.\nActive learning (Procedural and decision- making skill types)\nActive learning can be more effective than guided learning. The instructor creates a training environment in which the trainee can:\ni) learn to organise new information into existing mental frameworks which hold prior knowledge in order to generate new knowledge about the context; and ii) practise the application of newly acquired knowledge and skills. Knowledge, skills and behaviours attained at a higher (cognitive) level are retained for longer. An example is error management training where trainees are given the opportunity to make errors and learn from them. Trainers should do the following: i) Present trainees with a series of practice examples illustrating the range of different conditions that they may subsequently encounter in the field including any unusual situations; and ii) Encourage trainees to think about these situations, make errors and learn from them.\nGuided training can be blended with active learning for complex tasks by directing trainees in how to explore training resources and make errors so that it is clear that they are an expected aspect of training. This ensures that trainees experience the same set of\nerrors and do not feel responsible for them.\nTask-oriented training (e.g. knowledge and decision-making skill types)\nUse the context of a given task to train the knowledge, cognitive skills and behaviours required instead of teaching material at an abstract level without reference to how it will be applied on the job.\nThis strategy optimises the level of original learning and retention.\nStandard training scenario (Relevant to all knowledge and skill types)\nUse of standard scenarios that are progressive in difficulty would allow students to build on knowledge and skills already gained. Standardisation also enables comparisons to be made between students and training facilities as all trainees would have a\nstandard background.\nTable 6: Training Strategies to Improve Retention of Knowledge and Skills"

    "content": "7. The training environment and implications of location for each training solution may well require analysis at this stage. For example, constraints on training resources and the availability of real equipment for training may force the emphasis towards workplace training. The same would be true if it is not possible to replicate critical Role PS Conditions in training establishments or via distributed training. Alternatively expensive and scarce training equipment or qualified trainers may only be available in [some] training establishments. It is therefore important to determine an estimate of where the balance between training to be delivered in a training establishment and workplace training will fall. It is based on a careful analysis of exactly what the TRA requires, tempered by that which is deliverable and can only be achieved by consultation with the TRA and the Training Provider, who will have knowledge of existing training and current training facilities and resources. This will later result in the allocation of TOs to a TPS, WTS, or, where no training will take place, the Performance, Conditions and Standards to a RTGS32. The output from this work could be an amendment to the Initial Training Categories or recommendations that take account of both DIF Analysis results and the impact of all other Role, training and resource factors."

    "content": "9. Type of learning. The Method used to deliver training depends on whether learning is categorised as Knowledge, a mental or physical Skill, or an Attitude. Each EO must be examined to determine whether it is primarily expressed as a KSA. This will suggest the appropriate choice of Method (e.g. a Skills-based EO must have some element of practice involved in the Method; whilst role-play is an example of a training Method suitable for a Behaviour-based EO). The aim must be to choose a Method that is compatible with the material to be learned. Learning a physical Skill may require equipment and machinery and a low trainee-to-trainer ratio as it tends to be trainee-centric. Knowledge learning is most effective and efficient via e-learning, in the form of a lecture, or with links to information. This works best in a flipped classroom, where learning is then consolidated through discussion."

The appropriate selection of training Methods improves the effectiveness and efficiency of learning. Wherever possible, a learner-focused approach should be adopted although this is not always as simple as it seems as it can be time consuming and resource heavy. A learner-focused approach aids information retention by considering the needs of the trainees and increasing their involvement in the learning process. A trainer-focused approach, whilst increasing trainee-to-trainer ratios, is not as effective for aiding trainee retention. The more active the trainee is in the learning process, the higher the rate of retention."

If training specialists become involved with costing or investment appraisal, they should obtain current advice from the TNASG or other authoritative body. CBA activity does not start at this stage of the TNA but the result of it is included in the Training Needs Report hence its inclusion here. Like many aspects of DSAT, CBA is an iterative process with initial activity commencing much earlier in the TNA process, as appropriate. The CBA will likely be further refined during the Method & Media selection process in Element 2 (Design). An estimate of the financial risks and/or opportunities associated with each training solution option should be undertaken.
