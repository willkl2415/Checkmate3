Evaluation activities do not focus solely on the provision of training (although this is a key activity) but also on the DSAT process and the Training System as a whole, including the Management Training System (MTS). In addition to evaluation, Element 4 activities includes Training Needs Evaluation (TNE) which is Stage 3 of the Training Needs Analysis (TNA). Evaluation activities are detailed in the Training Quality Manual (TQM) which is endorsed at the Customer Executive Board (CEB). The DSAT Quaity Management System (QMS) is key to assisting those involved in the evaluation of Defence training. The DSAT QMS is the standard that is met when the outputs of the DSAT Elements and the MTS activities are delivered correctly. The evaluation activities covered by this DTSM are: TNA, Stage 3 \u2013 TNE - This assesses and reports on the effectiveness of the TNA process as well as the ability of the implemented training solution to meet the Defence requirement. The TNE is conducted in 2 parts: evaluation of the process and evaluation of the training solution. The key output is an assessment of how well the TNA outputs contributed to the provision of a training solution that meets the Defence requirement. This completes the TNA process."

In devising an Evaluation Strategy the TRA develops a long-term action plan for achieving successful training. This requires the development of a strategy which aims to assess the total worth of a training activity. An Evaluation Strategy should therefore articulate the training to be evaluated, the types of evaluation to be applied and the roles and responsibilities of the people involved in the process. The Strategy should cover the whole cycle of training, starting when a training need is first identified and continuing until the required Defence outputs are achieved."

Analysis of data. The InVal process can generate considerable qualitative and quantitative feedback, some of which may be contradictory. In order to ensure that any changes made to training are positive, it is essential that a robust analysis of feedback data is implemented. When analysing data it is important that an analyst is familiar with the concepts of validity, reliability and triangulation: Validity. A measuring instrument is valid if it measures what it is intended to measure. For example, in training the most valid measuring instrument for a practical Skill is a practical test. A written test may well test whether the trainee knows what to do in a practical task but not if they can actually do it."

The term triangulation is used to describe the use of 2 or more data gathering techniques to investigate the same phenomenon. Confidence in the findings is enhanced when the techniques yield similar results. For example, if the outcomes of a questionnaire-based survey correspond to the findings of an observational study of the same phenomena, the more the analyst will be confident of the findings. In addition to the use of 2 or more data collection tools, triangulation can also be achieved using 2 or more analysts using the same research instrument. Factors that influence trainees\u2019 reaction to training. Despite the evaluators' best efforts to design feedback mechanisms which are both reliable and valid, it is important to realise that there is a range of external factors that may influence the content of InVal feedback.

The first aim of ExVal (Stage 3) is to determine the success of training in preparing individuals for their Role and whether the requirement is still valid. The following must be considered: Timing. Initially, after training, an individual\u2019s motivation will be increased. Performance, however, frequently suffers as people try to \u2018unlearn\u2019 old behaviours and practise new skills. Therefore, the timing of ExVal should be determined by both the length and complexity of the training activity that is being validated. Usually, an ExVal would be implemented between 6-18 months after the completion of training. On the other hand, if too long a period is left between the training event and the ExVal, it will be difficult to ascertain which KSA have been acquired as a result of training and which have been learnt subsequently."

The aim of Stage Evaluation is to assess overall benefits to the organisation of a particular training activity and whether it offered VfM. This Stage of evaluation is challenging in an organisation the size of the MOD. Defence Performance and Risk reporting mechanisms mean it is possible to measure whether training has directly contributed to Defence outputs by measuring performance against the Defence Board Defence Tasks which are, essentially, Defence\u2019s organisational goals. To evaluate business benefits to the organisation, training should be linked to the Defence Tasks and their subordinate SC objectives. Those conducting Stage Evaluation should bear in mind that there are many other factors external to training which may impact business performance (such as redundancy programmes, leadership in the workplace etc).

A measuring instrument is valid; that is, relevant and appropriate, if it measures what it is intended to measure. In training, the most valid measuring instrument for a practical skill is a practical test.

If the administration of the same test on two separate occasions is likely to bias responses, due to a learning effect, then it is possible to develop an alternate form of the test. Alternate form reliability, however, would need to be demonstrated. Discrimination. A measuring instrument should be sensitive enough to record differences between individuals in what is being measured. Similarly, the inability to discriminate between satisfactory and unsatisfactory training is of no use."

A theoretically superb assessment system is of no use if practical limitations, such as time, cost or workforce considerations prevent it from being used. Factors influencing the choice of data gathering tools The choice of data gathering tools is crucial in determining the effectiveness of the study. Influencing factors can be: The reason(s) for directing data gathering to be conducted. The resources allocated to the task (such as, timescale, workforce, funding). Level of expertise of the analysts. The size of the Target Population: Numbers of Role holders6 and supervisors/managers. Rank/experience. Trades/skill levels. Availability of target population/geographical influences. For example, questionnaires may be preferable to face to face interviews for a widely dispersed population in distant locations. The data gathering plan should be produced at an early stage, highlighting the tools, sources of data and resources that will be used. The relative advantages and disadvantages of the main data gathering process are discussed later in Chapter 5."

    "content": "Ethical considerations when gathering data There are several ethical considerations that need to be adhered to throughout the data collection process7. The respondents\u2019 right to privacy and the right to refuse to answer certain questions, or to be interviewed at all, should always be respected, and no undue pressure should be brought to bear. The reason for this caution whilst undertaking data collection is not only for the interviewee\u2019s benefit but also for the interviewer\u2019s. If an interviewee believes that answering questions honestly will harm them then they are more likely to give bland, misleading and uninformative answers. Any evaluation based on such data is invalid. When conducting interviews a manner conducive to following sound ethical considerations should be followed. Examples are: Honesty. The interviewer should portray a non-threatening manner and remain truthful and faithful to the purpose of the interview. This ensures that the interviewee also gives honest answers to any questions."

No attempt should be made to persuade a respondent to agree with the analyst\u2019s perspective. For example, an interviewer must be careful not to ask leading questions. Relevance. The reason for the data collection and the target population is to be made clear. The data collection tool must be objective and economic with the respondent\u2019s time. For example, an interview should be concise and focused. Rushed interviews with irrelevant questions reduce the credibility of the interviewer and the reliability of the data gathered. Confidentiality. If the data collected is to remain confidential, and the analyst has stated this, then confidentiality must be observed. If the respondent wishes to remain anonymous and if the analyst agrees then this agreement must also be observed. It may also be important that it is explained who will see the data collected and the analysis of the collected data. Such openness on the part of the analyst leads to respondents being equally open."

A relatively simple easy way of processing quantitative data is through some form of frequency statement which requires the use of standardised measures so that the varying perspectives and experiences of respondents can be identified by a number of predetermined response categories. A numerical value is then assigned to each category. Qualitative data gathering. Qualitative data can be defined as data gathered on individuals\u2019, feelings, opinions, beliefs etc using open ended questioning. Qualitative methods allow the study of selective issues in depth and detail. Qualitative data consist of detailed textual information rather than numerical information generated by quantitative techniques. Qualitative data can be generated from 3 main types of data collections: Questionnaires/written documents. Document analysis in qualitative terms includes excerpts, quotations or passages from organisational records and open- ended written responses to questionnaires and surveys."

Any difficulties found or comments made by the person completing it should be noted. The individual chosen should be either a member of the group for whom the questionnaire is intended, or as much like the members of this group as possible. Ideally, this procedure should be carried out a number of times with different people. The questionnaire is amended to solve problems and ambiguities found in the first stage. The amended questionnaire is then completed under the same conditions that will prevail when it is eventually administered. Again, members of the group used should be as near as possible to those for whom the questionnaire is intended. The respondents should be asked for comments or criticisms after they have completed the questionnaire."

Contact: Be prepared: \u2018read in and ready\u2019. Ensure a suitable environment. In time and enough time. Introduce yourself (if necessary). Be pleasant but not too amiable. Make sure the interviewee knows the object of the interview. Reduce tension. Start with an \u2018easy to talk about\u2019 topic. Content: Do not read out facts from forms. Use the appropriate language level and adjust as necessary. Ask one question at a time. Avoid leading questions. Avoid trick questions."

Control: Avoid interrupting the interviewee. Use pauses widely. Handle delicate issues carefully and as opportunity occurs. Summarise from time to time. Be flexible rather than rigid. Use open, probing then linked questions. Follow leads given by the interviewee. Keep a balance between the points of your plan. Make notes. Beware of bias. Avoid ridicule. Give the interviewee chance to add points at the end. Answer interviewees\u2019 questions and thank them. Recording responses. It is rarely possible to record all that a respondent says during an interview and it would be of little value in any case since all the answers would then appear to be different. What is necessary is the grouping of answers under suitable headings, so that the completed schedule will indicate clearly and concisely what the interviewee may have taken a quarter of an hour to say. It is then appropriate for the interviewer to indicate how the answer has been recorded (e.g. \u201cAm I right in putting you down as saying?\u201d). This gives the respondent time to think again and for the interviewer to check that what has been said has really been understood. If the answer does not fit under an already accepted heading then it must be inserted under a new heading, which will in turn be available for all subsequent interviews. A pocket-dictating machine may be useful but permission must be gained to use one. Recording interviews can also inhibit interviewees."

Establishing an effective good rapport with the interviewee(s). Advantages and disadvantages of interviews. Interviews have the advantage of being flexible, allowing subjects not previously considered by the interviewer to be raised and explored. They can be extremely time-consuming, hence they may be used to clarify issues raised from questionnaires for relatively small numbers. A structure must be developed (see Interview Schedule below) to record the strength of opinions given. Interviewers and those analysing the data need to be trained if similar opinions are to be rated by different individuals. Once achieved, information obtained from different interviewers can be compared:"

    "content": "Advantages: Easier to tailor to the audience. The interviewer can select only those questions that are relevant to a particular situation. This is particularly important when the Role in question is unusual and it would be time- consuming, costly and unacceptably bulky to produce a detailed questionnaire to cover all possibilities. The interview can be conducted with reasonable speed (depending on circumstances). Wide range of topics can be covered to required depth. Entirely new points of interest can arise. The interviewer can deal with these immediately and add them to the list of questions to be put to all remaining respondents. Personal contact can reinforce commitment to study and raise response rate. The interviewer can check that the respondent has understood technical expressions and terms which have been used in the questionnaire. For example, a term like \u2018Defence Writing\u2019 is open to numerous interpretations. To one person it may mean the mechanics of writing, i.e. layout, conventions etc, while to another it concerns matters of style and content."

Lack of objectivity, further to which the relationship between interviewer and respondent can become confrontational limiting transmission of objective information. Can be influenced by perception - there may be bias for, as well as against, a particular topic. Observations Requirements. Observation involves watching, recording and analysing. Observing a particular activity is influenced by the fact that human perception is highly subjective. The fact that an individual is equipped with functioning senses does not make that person a skilled observer. Different people looking at the same design or object will see different things, due in part to their interests, biases and backgrounds. Coding. The observation may be unstructured, with the person who is observing being as open-minded as possible and using his or her judgement about which events are considered important. Alternatively, it may be highly structured by the use of coded schedules that guide attention to specific types of event. The categories that are selected will be those where changes are expected as a result of training, or those that are thought to be particularly important to the success of the Role. Unstructured observations should be avoided. Use pre-determined criteria to increase the reliability and validity of the data collected."

Additional records containing details of time taken, lack of skills, incidence of accidents etc can sometimes complement these, which can be pointers towards areas of training deficiency. Log books. The log book can be a valuable source of information. Its main value lies in that it allows a direct comparison to be made between what the ex-trainee is able to do as a result of training and what they are required to do when employed on an operational task. Analysing Collected Data Quantitative and qualitative data analysis. Quantitative data by their very nature lend themselves to statistical analysis. However, with qualitative data there may be trends (patterns, themes) present, which could go unnoticed. One of the problems of dealing with qualitative data is the \u2018blizzard of information\u2019 that can be reproduced. This can often be unstructured in content and resource intensive in terms of workforce and time to analyse. Such considerations need to be included during initial project management planning. In analysing qualitative data the quality of the analyst must be taken into consideration, as unlike quantitative data analysis where the issues are more readily identifiable, qualitative analysis requires greater degree(s) of interpretation. Analysts must be conscious of the possibility of knee jerk reactions when confronting data for the first time"

    "content": "Qualitative data allow a vast amount of (potentially wide-ranging) information to be considered, allowing the respondent to provide depth of feeling over complex issues which may be difficult to elicit by purely quantitative terms alone. That said, in order to obtain a full picture, qualitative data should not be treated in isolation, but should be compared with quantitative data. Triangulation of data. Triangulation is the combination of different data gathering techniques to investigate the same issue and will usually combine both quantitative and qualitative data methods. For example, rather than simply completing a questionnaire in respect of how an individual performs a task, they might also be interviewed and observed conducting the task. The use of questionnaires together with observation, or qualitative with quantitative data gathering techniques, for example, can reduce the chance of distorting the results or introducing bias within the methodology. To that end triangulation allows greater confidence in the research results regardless of the data gathering methodologies applied."

    "content": "The DTSMs currently available are: Introduction Governance of individual training is the process through which decisions are made that determine the long-term strategy, direction and organisation of individual training across Defence. Individual Training Governance provides the framework through which training stakeholders are accountable for continuously improving the quality of their provision to meet Defence requirements. Governance of individual training is managed primarily through boards such as Customer Executive Board(s), Working Groups and Steering Groups. In Defence, individual training is conducted in a variety of single Service, Joint, and Defence training settings. The principles for the governance of Joint, Defence and single Services training requirements are the same. However, because of the additional complexities of Joint and Defence Training, there are differences when it comes to the structures and roles involved in the governance. Although JSP 822 does mandate specific governance activities for all training across, TLBs do retain significant levels of autonomy on the governance of individual training, that falls under their command. It is therefore essential that users of this DTSM also consult local policy documents that may exist, and are managed locally by training policy teams within the TLBs."

Governance Structures Introduction An Individual Training governance structure refers to the framework and system of rules, roles, responsibilities, and processes that a Defence organisation puts in place to ensure that the development, delivery, assurance and management of individual training remains on track, and appropriate to the organisation\u2019s requirements. Within Defence, an Individual Training governance structures usually takes the form of the traditional hierarchical structure, which is commonly found in other areas of Defence, and most large organisations. A hierarchical governance structure is a type of organisational structure in which authority and decision-making are organised in a top-down fashion, with a clear chain of command and defined levels of management. In this structure, individuals and teams at each level have specific roles, responsibilities, and decision making powers, and they report to higher levels of management."

Examples are provided in Section 2.2. Within this chapter, we have separated governance structures in to 3 types of training environments: Defence Training, Joint training, and single Service training. The principles around governance structures are the same, however, due to the more complex nature of Defence and Joint training, there are some differences around the formation of the structures. JSP 822 volume 10 defines Defence Training and Joint Training as: Defence Training: \u201cMultiple learning events that may be delivered to individual sS audiences but achieve the same output for all Services.\u201d"

It must be noted however, that a single Service training event may only be required by part of the TLB instead of the whole of the TLB. Even though it appears Defence and Joint training are the same, Joint training becomes Defence training once the number of Services participating spans to the whole of Defence. Governance Structures in single Service Training As highlighted in para 6, single Service training is a training event that is delivered only to one TLB. This means that the TLB, or more likely, the organisation within the TLB, is responsible for the analysis, design, delivery, assurance, management, and governance of the training event. As TLBs are responsible for the governance of the single Service training that they develop and deliver, they are therefore also responsible for establishing the governance structures."

For certain CEBs (e.g. where there are several TDAs, or where the TRA controls the resources, or where the TDA is a contractor), the TRA may decide that it is more appropriate for them to chair the CEB. Chairship should be clearly articulated in the ToRs. The TRA must ensure that a CEB is normally held biannually and both TRA and TDA should attend the CEBs2. Where there are matters that cannot be resolved as part of the CEB (e.g. a TRA believes the requirement is not being met or a TDA does not have the resource to deliver a requirement), these are to be escalated to a higher level within the relevant Chain of Command/TLB for resolution."

This chapter focuses on the governance of developing, implementing, and overseeing Defence Individual Training policy, which can be found within JSP 822. It involves a structured approach to policy creation, maintenance, and enforcement to ensure that Individual Training policies align with Defence\u2019s strategies and goals, and comply with laws and regulations. Governance Structure The governance structure of Defence Individual Training policy is relatively straightforward, and like training governance it uses a hierarchical structure. Defence Individual Training Policy can be found in JSP 822, and it is the responsibilities of the organisation Talent, Skills, Learning and Development (TSLD) to develop, manage and maintain JSP 822, and the policies contained within it. Defence Individual Training Policies are owned by SO1s that work within TSLD. The SO1s along with their teams, are responsible for developing and managing their policies on behalf of the Head of TSLD. See section 7.3 for more information on governance stakeholders."

Active participation is important for adults and they generally learn best by starting with a problem, working to find a solution, and reflecting on the outcome in order to draw conclusions about how they will do it differently next time, in order to increase performance. Where possible use realistic tasks, situations and scenarios for problem solving exercises. Learner-Centred Training Introduction Trainers need to provide training in a way that recognises trainees\u2019 life experiences and allows them to take ownership of their own learning2. In this way, they are motivated to learn and become independent and \u2018agile\u2019 learners. Learner-centred training means enabling trainees to actively take part in their learning, rather than passively receiving instruction. It means teaching trainees how to think and solve problems by drawing on their past experiences, using common sense and logic to research and evaluate evidence, then reflecting on their findings to reach conclusions. Learner-centred training uses active training techniques and lets trainees learn from each other and from their own mistakes. It promotes deeper learning, which is meaningful and memorable, rather than surface learning which is easily forgotten. It is the most effective and efficient way to provide learning."

Application of the  (PAR3) model is identified in Competency 2.1 as appropriate for the promotion of active learning. Competency 4.1 identifies the need for trainers to manage both individual and group needs during learning events. The PAR Model The PAR model is chosen by Defence as the easiest to understand and employ. It should be used as the basis for planning and facilitating all lessons. Trainers should reflect regularly on how learner-centred their lessons are and share good practice where a particular learner-centred approach has worked well (or even if it has not). They should also seek feedback from their trainees on which methods and techniques are most effective from their point of view. People learn from reflecting on their experiences, i.e., they do something and reflect on how successful it was, in order to draw conclusions, supporting by the trainer, on what they will do differently next time. Whilst having the experience themselves is preferable, if this is not possible, then the next best option is to consider the experience that somebody else has had, reflect on how successful it was, and draw conclusions, supported by the trainer, on how they will do it differently to be more successful.4"

Table 1: Lesson Structure and the PAR Model DTSM 4 (Edition, V1.0) Self-Regulated Learning Making training learner-centred also encourages trainees to  their learning, i.e. they monitor their own knowledge and skills and make decisions on how they can progress. Trainees who self-regulate their learning are motivated to learn through-life and are confident of their ability to learn, and so they are more likely to take action to remain competent and current in their job role. Trainers can teach trainees to self-regulate by prompting them to set and reflect on individual goals, using feedback to then identify and review what they did to achieve the goal. Concentrating more on what the trainee did (or did not do), rather than the actual outcome, helps to develop these self-monitoring capabilities. Learning from mistakes is also a very effective tool in self-regulated learning and trainees need to be given the freedom to make mistakes where safety, time and resources permit."

Self-regulation in learning describes a process of controlling and evaluating one\u2019s own learning6 and behaviour7. This process may be subconscious, but is more effective if a conscious activity. There are four stages17: task perception, goal setting, enacting and adaptation. Readiness, Resourcefulness, Resilience, Reflectiveness, Responsibility. Zimmerman, B.J. (2008).

Figure 1: Self-regulation in Learning Trainees who self-regulate their learning are motivated to learn through-life and are confident of their ability to learn, and so they are more likely to take action to remain competent and current in their job role. Trainers can teach trainees to self-regulate by prompting them to set and reflect on individual goals, using feedback to then identify and review what they did to achieve the goal. Concentrating more on what the trainee did (or did not do), rather than the actual outcome, helps to develop these self-monitoring capabilities. Learning from mistakes is also a very effective tool in self-regulated learning and trainees need to be given the freedom to make mistakes where safety, time and resources permit."

They help ensure that the associated trainers, support staff and trainees have a clear understanding of what the trainees are required to learn and to be able to do at the end of the lesson/learning event. TOs form the basis of the detailed design of each of the training lessons or collective training events as well as identification of appropriate training resources. They may also be used in support of the award of civilian accreditation. Therefore, the development and maintenance of accurate TOs is essential. TOs were drafted during Element 1, and these draft TOs should now be further refined and developed during Design Stage 1. TOs are precise statements of what tasks a trainee should be able to do, post training, in the Role and/or team environment that the training was designed to prepare them for. A TO is measurable and has three constituents: the Performance required, the Conditions under which the trainee must perform, and the Standard to which the trainee must perform. These statements should be in the form of observable and measurable behaviours which allow the achievement of the TOs to be confirmed through assessment. A TO defines what a successful trainee is able to do at the end of a period of training, i.e. the learning outcome10. It does not describe the learning process or any learning experience."

For example, if a very high Standard is required, the trainee will receive a large amount of training for the Performance (creating the possibility of becoming over-trained) and may be subject to strict assessment, such as no mistakes. The Standard should be accurate. Some Performances may be subject to external rules and regulations, i.e. the Standard is dictated such as13: Health and Safety. Nuclear. Weapons handling.

The Method used to deliver training depends on whether learning is categorised as Knowledge, a mental or physical Skill, or an Attitude. Each EO must be examined to determine whether it is primarily expressed as a KSA. This will suggest the appropriate choice of Method (e.g. a Skills-based EO must have some element of practice involved in the Method; whilst role-play is an example of a training Method suitable for a Behaviour-based EO). The aim must be to choose a Method that is compatible with the material to be learned. Learning a physical Skill may require equipment and machinery and a low trainee-to-trainer ratio as it tends to be trainee-centric. Knowledge learning is most effective and efficient via e-learning, in the form of a lecture, or with links to information.

The appropriate selection of training Methods improves the effectiveness and efficiency of learning. Wherever possible, a learner-focused approach should be adopted although this is not always as simple as it seems as it can be time consuming and resource heavy. A learner-focused approach aids information retention by considering the needs of the trainees and increasing their involvement in the learning process. A trainer-focused approach, whilst increasing trainee-to-trainer ratios, is not as effective for aiding trainee retention. The more active the trainee is in the learning process, the higher the rate of retention. See the Competence Retention Analysis (CRA) Handbook. Learning preferences. Learning takes place when learners reflect on what they have done, or from what others have done. This is the case for all learners, both in an individual and a collective setting. Therefore, it is imperative that for the effective and efficient acquisition of the required KSA, time is built into the programme, to facilitate learning through reflection. People learn from reflecting on their own, or others experience. Therefore, enabling experiential learning is the most effective and efficient way of enabling learning."

For knowledge acquisition, motivation best comes through a flipped classroom, where the learners are required to access the learning (through e-learning for example) before they consolidate and reflect on what they have learnt, in the classroom. Literacy level. Information should only be presented to learners in a form they can cope with. Information should not be at a level that they cannot comprehend, nor should it be at a level which will patronise. Key questions should include \u2018What is the literacy level of the trainees?\u2019 and \u2018What is the most appropriate language for passing information?\u2019 Numbers. How many trainees should there be in each group? A large group will make trainer demonstrations difficult to plan. A small group will limit trainee discussions and peer learning. Practical constraints. Facilities and resource availability are likely to limit the choice of Method and the most appropriate Media are not always practical or within budget. The medium may be unavailable; there may not be time to meet all the TOs; it may be difficult logistically or financially; or the group may be of mixed ability and unable to make the best use of the Media selected. Where resources to support the optimum training Method are not available, lack of availability is likely to affect the successful achievement of the TOs. Such constraints should be captured in the Constraints Analysis and/or the Risk Register. The TRA and Customer should be advised of this fact and made aware of the likely consequences."

The selection of the most effective and efficient way to meet a training requirement involves identifying a range of possible training solutions, in terms of the Methods & Media options that can be used. The choice of options will be dependent upon the requirement, training policy, training throughput and established good practice. These are evaluated by comparing the training and cost-effectiveness of each option, from which the most suitable solution can be chosen and recommended with supporting justification. Typically it is the Knowledge category of the KSA spectrum which can be handled most flexibly through DLE. The DLE is the primary Virtual Learning Environment for Defence and should be considered in the first instance to facilitate various methods and media as part of a blended approach. Defence Direction for Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) is contained within JSP 822, Volume 6. A particular training Media may appear to be best suited to a particular training activity but can only be adopted as the solution if all resourcing issues (effectiveness, workforce, equipment and facilities etc) combine to produce the most effective, efficient and economic overall through-life package. It is therefore important to determine the personnel, facilities and equipment required to train, and cost them over the lifetime of the training activity including Design, Delivery and Evaluation. Cost-effectiveness can be analysed at a simple level by comparing costs for a number of different areas. Examples where appropriate are:"

An agile force is one whose people learn continuously, from experience and from each other, as well as from training courses. Learning in the workplace is just as important as learning on a course and requires the support of qualified trainers. Whether in the workplace or a training establishment, the underlying principles and standards for the delivery of Defence training remain the same. Training provision is the process conducted by the Training Provider that enables and allows trainees to learn. It is the outputs that ensure trainers are trained, learning activities are piloted, programmed and resourced, learning is prepared for, training deficiencies are managed, risks are assessed and trainees are appropriately cared for. The Principles of Defence Training The effectiveness of training delivery will be measured by the Training Provider and appropriate governance body according to whether the intended outcomes (the TOs) have been achieved successfully. This is determined through the formal assessment process, but there will also be other, indirect outcomes of training (e.g. motivation to learn and creating independent learners) which will need to be considered when planning and preparing effective training. These are not as easy to measure, but they are important if trainees are to perform to the best of their ability. To ensure that all the desired outcomes are achieved when preparing training, the following principles of training delivery1 should be applied:"

    "content": "Learner-Centred Training Introduction Trainers need to provide training in a way that recognises trainees\u2019 life experiences and allows them to take ownership of their own learning2. In this way, they are motivated to learn and become independent and \u2018agile\u2019 learners. Learner-centred training means enabling trainees to actively take part in their learning, rather than passively receiving instruction. It means teaching trainees how to think and solve problems by drawing on their past experiences, using common sense and logic to research and evaluate evidence, then reflecting on their findings to reach conclusions. Learner-centred training uses active training techniques and lets trainees learn from each other and from their own mistakes. It promotes deeper learning, which is meaningful and memorable, rather than surface learning which is easily forgotten. It is the most effective and efficient way to provide learning. The DTCF sets out the requirement for \u201clearning events to be learner- centric and structured to the learning process,\u201d in Competency Group 2 and the requirement that \u201cindividuals are actively engaged in the learning process\u201d in Competency Group 4. Application of the  (PAR3) model is identified in Competency 2.1 as appropriate for the promotion of active learning. Competency 4.1 identifies the need for trainers to manage both individual and group needs during learning events."

Trainers should reflect regularly on how learner-centred their lessons are and share good practice where a particular learner-centred approach has worked well (or even if it has not). They should also seek feedback from their trainees on which methods and techniques are most effective from their point of view. People learn from reflecting on their experiences, i.e., they do something and reflect on how successful it was, in order to draw conclusions, supporting by the trainer, on what they will do differently next time. Whilst having the experience themselves is preferable, if this is not possible, then the next best option is to consider the experience that somebody else has had, reflect on how successful it was, and draw conclusions, supported by the trainer,  on  how  they  will  do  it  differently  to  be  more  successful.  4"

In feedback, trainers should concentrate on mastery (strategies and processes) rather than the outcome (overall performance or product) itself in order to help learners develop self-monitoring capabilities. The Campaign for Learning (2013) 9 identified 5 attributes of the self-regulated learner: Adapted from Petty, G. (2009). Evidence Based Teaching (2nd ed).

Statement of Training Task Once accepted by the appropriate governance body (such as the CEB), the SOTR is used as the source document to develop the SOTT. The purpose of the SOTT is to allow the Training Provider to take the agreed output-based requirement and develop it into a deliverable training solution for the following year. In addition to the information already contained in the SOTR, the SOTT should contain, as a minimum: The training activity profile (number of courses/exercises etc with start and finish dates). The total trainee input number and the disaggregated (the number of trainees per training activity) number by training activity."

Time is at a premium in most training environments and a lesson/event which runs over time, or which fails to deliver all of the planned KLPs in the time allowed is likely to have a significant impact on other parts of the schedule. The environment. Clearly the environment can have an impact on learning, and, for the trainer, this is even more relevant, given that the environment could vary from a hi-tech simulation suite to a shell-scrape in a forest on exercise. Whilst it may not always be possible to choose the best environment in which to conduct training, good planning will ensure that the potential barriers presented by less than perfect surroundings are reduced or removed. Lesson/event plans should contain sufficient information on how the environment will be managed, including the safety brief and risk assessment."

The workplace environment may be very different from a more structured training environment and will have its own advantages and disadvantages. Potential barriers to workplace learning include: Distractions. Learning in the workplace is a much more informal environment and the trainer may have less control over distractions like background noise and interruptions. While this may create a much more realistic context for the trainee, it may also hamper the delivery of new information and could impact on safety.

For workplace training to be properly effective, the trainer should plan not only the tasks and activities to be conducted but also the Method of confirmation to be used, whether this is just through question and answer session, observing completion of a task, summarising the KLPs at the end of a task or allowing the trainees to summarise themselves what has been learned. Standardising Training Delivery Introduction In order to ensure that training is analysed, designed, delivered and assured to a set standard, Defence uses the Defence Systems Approach to Training. A great deal of work goes into the design and development of training to make sure that it is relevant, realistic and prepares Defence personnel properly for the jobs they have to do. Well-designed training, however, can still fail if it is not delivered in the way it was intended. Training deliverers must therefore comply with the specifications of the training design when they deliver their lessons. The DTCF sets out the requirement for trainers to employ \u201crelevant DSAT course documentation to identify desired learning outcomes and plan collective learning events\u201d in Competency 2.1 and to adapt \u201cdelivery according to trainee response while still achieving planned outcomes\u201d in Competency 4.1.

In larger Training Providers it is essential that trainers adhere to the programme as resources will need to be carefully managed to meet the needs of a high number of trainees on different training activities. 10Scheduling Training Delivery Introduction 1. Once training activities are programmed the elements should be sequenced, or scheduled, in order that the training is conducted in the correct order to optimise both the acquisition and retention of the KSA. This ensures that training is built up and TOs and their dependent EOs and KLPs are delivered in the order that maintains the integrity of their dependencies (i.e. that the achievement of a TO may require dependent EOs/KLPs to be conducted in a particular sequence in order to ensure that the trainees\u2019 KSA is built up progressively). This, however, may not always be necessary. The course schedule or programme is usually produced by the Course Design Cell as part of the course documentation. Particularly in larger training organisations, it is essential that trainers stick to the planned course schedule, as resources and classrooms will need to be carefully managed to meet the needs of a high number of trainees and different courses. Where there is a need to change the course schedule, this should always be approved by the course manager and trainers should aim to avoid short notice changes wherever possible."

All trainers will be required to work with a mix of trainees who may be affected by one or more of these barriers. Failure to address this can have a significant impact on trainee motivation, performance and retention. Trainers must therefore ensure that everyone has the same opportunity to learn, develop and succeed. That means preventing barriers from arising where possible and helping individuals to deal with barriers when they do arise. This is known as inclusion in training. The DTCF sets out the requirement for learning events to be \u201caligned with trainee motivation\u201d and for resources to \u201cactively engage the learner\u201d in Competency Group 2.

Trainees that fail assessments or otherwise do not meet the required standard of performance within the prescribed conditions should be given all available and practical opportunities to be provided with additional, or remedial, training in order to both give the trainee the best possible opportunity to pass the training activity. This will ensure the costs and resources expended on training are not wasted. Re-testing should only be conducted once the trainee has received remedial training to fill the Knowledge, Skill or Attitude gap. Re- testing without remedial training will likely be a waste of resource. A remedial training strategy should consider:"

If an assessment is conducted using the same instructions every time, all trainees should receive exactly the same assessment, regardless of when, where and by whom the assessment is conducted. Moderation. Moderation of marking can also help to ensure that the marking of assessments by different trainers is equitable and fair. In this case, a random sample of marked assessments is marked again by another trainer without first seeing the original score or grades awarded. The resulting scores are then compared to see if they agree. Where scores do not agree, trainers should consult with other trainers, and as a team, identify where the marking system is flawed and adjust scores/grades accordingly. Any problems with the marking criteria should be highlighted to the DTS, DTM or Chain of Command. Although it takes many forms, Assessment serves one of two purposes: formative assessment that allows judgement or measurement of progress towards a goal or summative assessment that judges or measures whether that goal has been reached. Both measures can be norm referenced \u2013 making comparison with others (performance orientation) or criterion referenced \u2013 making comparison to a standard (mastery orientation). Assessment, then, is the primary measure available to the learner regarding their achievement. It is also the evidence base of that achievement."

Assessment, to be more than a process that just gathers data, must be meaningful to the organisation (actually constitute proof of competence) and be meaningful to the learner through a process of feedback. Assessment Strategy The AStrat is useful as it ensures that the assessments are reliable, valid and administered correctly.

Trainers should always use an up to date ASpec when planning an assessment. The main purpose of the ASpec is to control what is assessed and how. It is important Trainers assess all of the EOs and KLPs as specified in the ASpec and not make any changes that alter these. The manner in which the assessment is conducted is determined by the ASpec. Designers strive to provide as much realism as possible, sometimes by using simulation, instrumented or scenario-based activities and so unauthorised changes to the realism of a practical assessment may make it invalid. If limited resources make it difficult to deliver the assessment in the recommended way or the ASpec appears too restrictive, the DTS, DTM or Chain of Command should be informed."

Trainers should be able to administer assessments in a fair, valid and reliable manner according to the specifications provided. This is particularly important because workplace assessments may not be conducted under the same conditions that would usually be expected in more structured training environment. Workplace assessments are generally practical in nature and are used to test individuals or teams in the achievement of a Skill, or Skills, both mental and physical. They can assess either the product of the Skill or the process involved in employing the Skills and should have an associated checklist to ensure both reliability and objectivity in assessment. The WTS will often require the trainees to be assessed on a Skill that has already been practised and assessed in a simulated environment but which now needs to be confirmed in a live environment. It is important that workplace assessments are conducted in a context that properly reflects the real challenges of the Role. Workplace assessments can be either formative or summative.

It is about helping trainees learn for themselves rather than delivering training to them. Coaching techniques form an integral part of the trainer\u2019s toolbox. Everything should be geared towards ensuring that trainees are successful. Often that simply means responding positively and constructively to their efforts and setting new challenges for them. There will also be times when a more focused individual approach is needed (e.g. to develop a trainee who is struggling, or to motivate a trainee who is finding training too easy).

    "content": "Continuous Professional Development for Training Delivery Roles Introduction What is CPD? CPD stands for Continuing Professional Development. It is any activity that updates your knowledge or develops your skills in your job role. Why do CPD? CPD updates your knowledge and skills, keeping you current and preparing you for the future. It benefits you, the individuals you are training and the operational effectiveness of your organisation. Evidence of your CPD can also count towards gaining JPA Level 3 (Advanced Practitioner) and recognised civilian qualifications. How much CPD should I be doing? Defence Direction mandates that those working in a Defence training delivery role should complete a minimum of 5 hours\u2019 CPD per year. The focus of CPD is firmly on you as an individual, so one size doesn\u2019t fit all. You will need to decide what type and how much CPD is best for you at a particular stage in your career, but you can get help from your supervisor or line manager, or by sharing and comparing ideas with colleagues."

    "content": "What counts as CPD? The answer is a lot of what you are doing already without perhaps realising it. The Plan, Develop, Support, Share (PDSS) model at Figure 2 summarises the main areas that constitute CPD for an individual working in a training delivery role. Figure 3: CPD PDSS Model Table 13 has some examples of CPD activities: Table 14: Examples of CPD activities Choosing CPD Activities Some CPD activities, such as workshops, seminars and team meetings, will be directed and organised by your unit. Other activities will be your individual choice and these should focus on personal abilities, goals and opportunities. It is important to plan these individual activities to make sure that you get the most from the time spent on CPD, by focusing on areas that will benefit you in your job role and your career. Your CPD plan should map out what you personally need to achieve in order to reach your development goals. The plan is specific to you and so there is no set format, but a Defence planning template is available from DCTS if you wish to use it. To create the plan, you need to do the following:"

    "content": "Step 1: Identify your goals. One of the problems that people face when trying to improve their performance is defining what they want to achieve and how they need to develop. It will help to discuss your goals with someone else, e.g. a DTS, your line manager, or you may wish to seek advice from a professional body that you are a member of. You may also find that it helps to create a performance profile when setting goals. DCTS has a proforma to help with this. Step 2: Identify your learning and development needs. Having identified your goals, the next step is to break them down into the skills and knowledge you need to develop in order to achieve them. Ask yourself the following questions in relation to each of your goals: What skills do I need to be able to do, or what do I need to be able to do better? What new knowledge do I need? Step 3: Identify specific CPD activities. Once you have identified your goals and defined your needs, your next step is to decide what activities will meet those needs. When defining your activities, try to make them clear and explicit. If others are involved, identify who they are and state when things are going to happen. It is important that you identify a timescale for each activity to help yourself prioritise events and be realistic about what you can achieve. If you are considering a course of study, check how much time and resources are available to you \u2013 remember, if you have a clearly defined and logical CPD plan, you are more likely to be successful in gaining support from your Chain of Command."

    "content": "Introduction The Armed Forces have a unique training ethos. It is a combination of firm discipline, high quality rigorous training, maintenance of high standards, a sense of fair play, treating the trainee as an individual and encouraging people to achieve tasks and skills far beyond those that they first thought themselves capable of. Training is successful if it results in a high level of skill, self-discipline, initiative and obedience to orders in the moment of crisis. Successful training also delivers independent learners, who are motivated to continue to learn through life and thus are able to deal with the complex, the uncertain and the unexpected. Defence training is characterised by a strong sense of purpose, relevance to the operational environment and the will to develop the core Values and Standards of the Armed Forces in the individual. Skill, strength and forbearance are admired and encouraged; there is no place for cruelty, callousness or meanness. A strong sense of appropriate humour pervades the way in which this training is delivered. This defines the challenge to those who deliver Defence training, each of whom will be held as a role model to the trainee in all that they do."

    "content": "The Defence Code of Practice for Trainers applies to all Service and civilian trainers employed by the Ministry of Defence. Underpinned by the core Values and Standards of the Armed Forces, it serves to unify and complement the various training courses provided for the different trainer roles, by setting out common standards of practice which are central to the delivery of Defence training. All trainers are expected to adhere to the Code\u2019s ethos and meet the standards set out within it. Standards for the Delivery of Training Standards in Training. All trainees should be given the same opportunity to learn and achieve. The trainer promotes an inclusive learning culture by helping trainees to avoid or deal with different barriers to learning. This can present a challenge, particularly in Phase 1 and 2 training, to get the right balance between encouraging and supporting a trainee whose true potential may only be faintly visible, and warning, perhaps even helping to discharge, those who are never going to achieve the required standard. Each case must be treated on its own merits and you should make every effort to motivate and support your trainees, but this should not be at the expense of the standards required to maintain operational effectiveness. In all cases, you should focus first on 'training in' rather than 'selecting out'."

    "content": "Respect in Training. It is important that a relationship exists between the trainer and trainee based on mutual respect. Respect from a trainee cannot be demanded or expected; you must never abuse your position of authority. Good trainers will continually seek to develop the trainee's self-belief with constructive criticism and encouragement, and will naturally be afforded respect as a result. Physically striking or humiliating a trainee or the use of threatening, rude or abusive language is counterproductive and is not tolerated within the Armed Services. Sensible and Achievable Training. Training must be progressive, safe and sensibly achievable. Safe training does not mean being over-cautious, unadventurous or dull but you must not push trainees faster than they can learn and they must be allowed time to learn from their mistakes. Consider your audience carefully when planning training, and make sure that your expectations take into account the background, military knowledge and experience of your trainees."

    "content": "Challenging Training. Phase 1 training by its very nature presents a considerable challenge to a young person but care should be taken to ensure that subsequent and further training also challenges every trainee mentally, physically and intellectually. If not, they may feel patronised and quickly become demotivated. This applies particularly to Phase 3 training, where trainees will have greater breadth of maturity and military experience. You should always acknowledge trainees\u2019 previous experience and aim to provide sufficient challenge for all levels of background and ability. Safety in Training. If training is to be effective, it must include exposure to the conditions (real or simulated) that will be present in operations. This will often incorporate some level of risk. Whilst risk management is the duty of the chain of command, responsibility will also rest with the trainer in direct control of the activity. You must therefore manage risk in order to deliver training as safely as possible. Where you believe, in a particular situation, that the training benefits are outweighed by real risks to life and limb, you have a duty to step in and modify the training. Training safety will be enhanced by application of the following principles:"

    "content": "Risk Assessment. Prior to conducting training, a risk assessment must be completed by a competent (qualified, experienced and current) individual. Nevertheless, you must always conduct your own assessment prior to the start of training and, if applicable, record any deviations from the lesson plan. You should continue to review that assessment during training in order to adapt to changing conditions (equipment, weather, tiredness, etc). If appropriate, trainees should be briefed on any changes in the plan resulting from a revised risk assessment. Safety Instructions. Before any training commences an appropriate set of safety orders/instructions are to be published and a safety briefing must always be given based on those orders/instructions. Repetitive training may be covered by standing orders, provided that these are briefed at regular intervals. Orders and instructions should include any actions to be taken in the event of an emergency. Trainer/Trainee Ratios. For many training activities, including adventurous training, weapons training and physical training, there will be a recommended ratio of trainers to trainees. You must be aware of the guidelines and plan the training accordingly."

    "content": "Competition in Training. Competition between individuals or teams involving mental or physical endeavour can be an excellent tool for improving performance, developing robustness and the desire to win. You should strive to encourage healthy competition in your training but, balance and care are always required to ensure that trainees are encouraged and motivated but not demoralised. Humour in Training. Humour is a powerful tool in the provision of effective training. You should, where possible, aim to make training fun so that a trainee will find it memorable and will be looking forward to the next session; however, care must be taken to avoid misdirected humour. Knowing where to draw the line can be difficult, particularly with trainees who you do not know you as well as you know your colleagues. Anything that belittles trainees is definitely NOT appropriate and is almost certain to create a barrier to learning which will then have to be dealt with later. If in doubt about a remark, don\u2019t use it."

You should also be prepared to provide a sympathetic ear when trainees need to discuss issues outside of training, particularly (but not exclusively) in training environments where they are living away from home. You need to be able to signpost and refer trainees to specialist support as required. Relaxation for Trainees. All trainees need breaks if they are to get the most from training and time must be programmed in when they can rest, relax and recover. Strenuous training (both physical and mental) over a long period of time may lead to fatigue and therefore proper time for meals, rest and free time must be given to trainees.

    "content": "Leadership. Trainers are expected to set the highest standards of motivational and inspirational leadership at all times, and to demonstrate, by example, the same leadership expected on operations. A good trainer uses motivational feedback to develop trust and inspire confidence and self-belief in trainees. You should communicate enthusiasm, encourage perseverance and always be optimistic of trainee success. You must also have the moral courage to demonstrate sound principles, high personal standards, values and a strong code of ethics at all times; but particularly when making decisions under stress. Good leadership is vital in this respect and you should participate fully in the rigors and hardship of training and inspire your trainees through commitment and example. Equality in Training. All trainees must be accorded fair and equal treatment, whatever their rank, gender, sexual orientation, religion, social background, race or ethnic origin. No harassment, intimidation, abuse, humiliation or unlawful discrimination of any kind will be tolerated anywhere within the Armed Forces. You must lead by example: you should make it absolutely clear that you disapprove of any form of discrimination and you should foster an environment where a complaint can be made without fear of retribution."

    "content": "Discipline in training You must clearly understand your disciplinary powers as published in the orders and regulations of your organisation. Unofficial disciplinary procedures can be interpreted as bullying or as an abuse of authority and, for these reasons, all disciplinary action must be clearly recorded and open for inspection. Nevertheless, you should not defer giving reasonable but firm orders or taking appropriate action for fear that they will be challenged by a trainee on the grounds of, for example, harassment. Moral courage must be exercised at all times and any inappropriate behaviour or poor attitude/effort towards training must be challenged. Personal relationships in training. The relationship between a trainer and a trainee is inevitably often a close one. Some trainees, particularly young recruits, can develop a sense of awe and hero worship that goes beyond professional respect and admiration. You must recognise this and not allow a situation to develop that might lead to an unhealthy abuse of your authority or give a trainee the opportunity to take advantage. Maintain a professional distance at all times and take care to ensure that you do not become over involved with any trainee. Failure to do so can lead to unacceptable personal relationships, accusations of favouritism or even allegations of misconduct."
