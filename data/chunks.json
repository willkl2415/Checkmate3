This is determined through the formal assessment process, but there will also be other, indirect outcomes of training (e.g. motivation to learn and creating independent learners) which will need to be considered when planning and preparing effective training. These are not as easy to measure, but they are important if trainees are to perform to the best of their ability. To ensure that all the desired outcomes are achieved when preparing training, the following principles of training delivery1 should be applied: Trainer as role model, Learner-centred training, Self-regulated learning, Technology in training, Inclusion in training, Standardising training.

Adults are internally motivated and self-directed. Adult learners resist learning when they feel others are imposing information, ideas or actions on them. They prefer to have control over what they learn and when they learn it. Guide (rather than direct) students to foster their internal motivation to learn and move them toward more self- directed and independent learning. Adults bring life experiences and knowledge to learning experiences. Adults like to be given the opportunity to make use of their existing foundation of knowledge and life experience to support their new learning experiences. Identify and acknowledge students’ past experience and use active learning techniques that allow them to problem solve using logical reasoning and common sense."

Adults learn by reflecting on what they have done, or what others have done.

In this way, they are motivated to learn and become independent and ‘agile’ learners. Learner-centred training means enabling trainees to actively take part in their learning, rather than passively receiving instruction. It means teaching trainees how to think and solve problems by drawing on their past experiences, using common sense and logic to research and evaluate evidence, then reflecting on their findings to reach conclusions. Learner-centred training uses active training techniques and lets trainees learn from each other and from their own mistakes. It promotes deeper learning, which is meaningful and memorable, rather than surface learning which is easily forgotten. It is the most effective and efficient way to provide learning."

Trainers should aim to use these basic coaching techniques both when delivering lessons and when working with individual trainees. Self-regulation in learning describes a process of controlling and evaluating one’s own learning6 and behaviour7. This process may be subconscious, but is more effective if a conscious activity.

They help ensure that the associated trainers, support staff and trainees have a clear understanding of what the trainees are required to learn and to be able to do at the end of the lesson/learning event. TOs form the basis of the detailed design of each of the training lessons or collective training events as well as identification of appropriate training resources. They may also be used in support of the award of civilian accreditation. Therefore, the development and maintenance of accurate TOs is essential.

Whilst test standards should be set as closely as possible to those stated against the TO, there are certain areas where compromise may be necessary when setting test standards. The identification of Standards relating to personal qualities, attitudes and behaviours is perhaps the most challenging part of TO development. This is because attitudes cannot be observed directly and hence the precision associated with other Standards is rarely possible. For subjective judgements objective criteria should, where possible, be used to support the decision (e.g. what observable behaviour is the key indicator that a trainee has acquired the appropriate Standard?). Defining the negative, what is unacceptable behaviour, can result in a simpler and more precise Standard."

The aim must be to choose a Method that is compatible with the material to be learned.

Whether in the workplace or a training establishment, the underlying principles and standards for the delivery of Defence training remain the same. Training provision is the process conducted by the Training Provider that enables and allows trainees to learn.

Trainers should aim to use these basic coaching techniques both when delivering lessons and when working with individual trainees. Self-regulation in learning describes a process of controlling and evaluating one’s own learning6 and behaviour7. This process may be subconscious, but is more effective if a conscious activity.

Clearly the environment can have an impact on learning, and, for the trainer, this is even more relevant, given that the environment could vary from a hi-tech simulation suite to a shell-scrape in a forest on exercise. Whilst it may not always be possible to choose the best environment in which to conduct training, good planning will ensure that the potential barriers presented by less than perfect surroundings are reduced or removed. Lesson/event plans should contain sufficient information on how the environment will be managed, including the safety brief and risk assessment."

Both measures can be norm referenced – making comparison with others (performance orientation) or criterion referenced – making comparison to a standard (mastery orientation). Assessment, then, is the primary measure available to the learner regarding their achievement. It is also the evidence base of that achievement. As with other learning activities the principles of motivation, goal orientation, believability, relevance (both to the operational requirement but also to that stage of development and learning) and trust are applicable. Assessment needs to be sufficiently challenging to be credible and to test deep learning should use higher levels of Blooms Taxonomy.

It contains all the information needed to conduct a valid assessment including the type of test, marking details, pass/fail criteria for the assessment of TOs and the consequences of failure. Trainers should always use an up to date ASpec when planning an assessment. The main purpose of the ASpec is to control what is assessed and how. It is important Trainers assess all of the EOs and KLPs as specified in the ASpec and not make any changes that alter these. The manner in which the assessment is conducted is determined by the ASpec. Designers strive to provide as much realism as possible, sometimes by using simulation, instrumented or scenario-based activities and so unauthorised changes to the realism of a practical assessment may make it invalid. If limited resources make it difficult to deliver the assessment in the recommended way or the ASpec appears too restrictive, the DTS, DTM or Chain of Command should be informed."

Incentive and reward will clearly only be effective if it is relevant to the individual’s personal goals, but where individuals are performing to a high standard in training delivery, the provision of funding and/or study time for a higher level qualification may be a suitable option, which will benefit both the individual and the organisation."

This question is answered through InVal. Level 2 - Learning. Were new Skills and Knowledge acquired and Attitudes developed? This question is answered through InVal. Level 3 - Behaviour.

(1967), Evaluation of Training in, ‘Training and Development Handbook,’ edited by Craig, R.L. and Bittel, L.R. London: McGraw Hill. In devising an Evaluation Strategy the TRA develops a long-term action plan for achieving successful training. This requires the development of a strategy which aims to assess the total worth of a training activity. An Evaluation Strategy should therefore articulate the training to be evaluated, the types of evaluation to be applied and the roles and responsibilities of the people involved in the process. The Strategy should cover the whole cycle of training, starting when a training need is first identified and continuing until the required Defence outputs are achieved."

If it is a reliable measuring instrument it should also give similar results when it is administered twice to the same group at different times. Triangulation. The term triangulation is used to describe the use of 2 or more data gathering techniques to investigate the same phenomenon. Confidence in the findings is enhanced when the techniques yield similar results. For example, if the outcomes of a questionnaire-based survey correspond to the findings of an observational study of the same phenomena, the more the analyst will be confident of the findings. In addition to the use of 2 or more data collection tools, triangulation can also be achieved using 2 or more analysts using the same research instrument."

Despite the evaluators' best efforts to design feedback mechanisms which are both reliable and valid, it is important to realise that there is a range of external factors that may influence the content of InVal feedback. Every attempt should be made to take these into consideration when conducting an analysis. For example, trainees' reactions to training can be influenced by many factors, including: Their relationship with their trainer. Their attitude towards attending the training. The influence of peers. How hard or easy they found the training. The perceived relevance of the training. The quality of the delivery of the training."

The respondents’ right to privacy and the right to refuse to answer certain questions, or to be interviewed at all, should always be respected, and no undue pressure should be brought to bear. The reason for this caution whilst undertaking data collection is not only for the interviewee’s benefit but also for the interviewer’s. If an interviewee believes that answering questions honestly will harm them then they are more likely to give bland, misleading and uninformative answers. Any evaluation based on such data is invalid. When conducting interviews a manner conducive to following sound ethical considerations should be followed. Examples are: Honesty. The interviewer should portray a non-threatening manner and remain truthful and faithful to the purpose of the interview.

In deciding what personal details are required, the analyst will be guided by the requirement of the analysis. The analyst must ensure that the questionnaire asks for all the details that will provide meaningful data for the analysis, while at the same time not asking for details that are clearly irrelevant to the analysis, as by doing so this may tend to alienate some respondents. If the analyst requires some particular detail, but considers that the respondent may not realise why it is required, the analyst must explain the reason behind asking for the information. Increasing the degree of openness of the potential response received can be achieved by offering anonymity (discussed earlier) by not including clearly attributable details in the personal details. However, if anonymity is quoted it must be honoured. Questions over confidentiality cannot only taint the study but may also negate the chance for further open and honest dialogue."

It is rarely possible to record all that a respondent says during an interview and it would be of little value in any case since all the answers would then appear to be different. What is necessary is the grouping of answers under suitable headings, so that the completed schedule will indicate clearly and concisely what the interviewee may have taken a quarter of an hour to say. It is then appropriate for the interviewer to indicate how the answer has been recorded (e.g. “Am I right in putting you down as saying?”). This gives the respondent time to think again and for the interviewer to check that what has been said has really been understood. If the answer does not fit under an already accepted heading then it must be inserted under a new heading, which will in turn be available for all subsequent interviews.

Individual Training Governance provides the framework through which training stakeholders are accountable for continuously improving the quality of their provision to meet Defence requirements. Governance of individual training is managed primarily through boards such as Customer Executive Board(s), Working Groups and Steering Groups."

The principles for the governance of Joint, Defence and single Services training requirements are the same. However, because of the additional complexities of Joint and Defence Training, there are differences when it comes to the structures and roles involved in the governance. Although JSP 822 does mandate specific governance activities for all training across, TLBs do retain significant levels of autonomy on the governance of individual training, that falls under their command. It is therefore essential that users of this DTSM also consult local policy documents that may exist, and are managed locally by training policy teams within the TLBs."

This manual also provides details on the processes and frameworks in place when it comes to the governance of individual training policy. Governance Structures Introduction An Individual Training governance structure refers to the framework and system of rules, roles, responsibilities, and processes that a Defence organisation puts in place to ensure that the development, delivery, assurance and management of individual training remains on track, and appropriate to the organisation’s requirements. Within Defence, an Individual Training governance structures usually takes the form of the traditional hierarchical structure, which is commonly found in other areas of Defence, and most large organisations."

    "content": "A hierarchical governance structure is a type of organisational structure in which authority and decision-making are organised in a top-down fashion, with a clear chain of command and defined levels of management. In this structure, individuals and teams at each level have specific roles, responsibilities, and decision making powers, and they report to higher levels of management. By using a hierarchical governance structure, organisations from across Defence ensures that there is a direct link between the trainee undergoing the training activity and the heads of the various Top-Level Budgets (TLBs) that exist within Defence. Figure 1: A Straightforward Hierachial Training Governance Structure used in Defence Figure 1 displays a straightforward governance structure, however, across Defence, governance structures tend to be more complex with additional groups to support the main governance groups. Examples are provided in Section 2.2."

The principles around governance structures are the same, however, due to the more complex nature of Defence and Joint training, there are some differences around the formation of the structures. JSP 822 volume 10 defines Defence Training and Joint Training as: Defence Training: “Multiple learning events that may be delivered to individual sS audiences but achieve the same output for all Services.” Joint Training. “A learning event where two or more Services participate together.”"

It must be noted however, that a single Service training event may only be required by part of the TLB instead of the whole of the TLB. Even though it appears Defence and Joint training are the same, Joint training becomes Defence training once the number of Services participating spans to the whole of Defence. Governance Structures in single Service Training As highlighted in para 6, single Service training is a training event that is delivered only to one TLB. This means that the TLB, or more likely, the organisation within the TLB, is responsible for the analysis, design, delivery, assurance, management, and governance of the training event."

Across Defence, TLBs broadly have similar structures where individual TLBs have common governance groups that sit above CEBs. These groups have the responsibility for the governance of all individual training for that TLBs. Figures 2 provides an example of a TLB training governance structure.

    "content": "A TNA is a structured analysis of training need arising as a result of new equipment acquisition, doctrinal change, organisational change, or changes to policy/legislation. It generally includes an analysis of different training Methods and technologies, with a view to recommending the optimum training solution which balances cost and quality. It is a highly flexible procedure with the choice of supporting tools and techniques to suit different Training Systems. In all cases, however, a TNA is an output based, iterative process that provides an audit trail for all decisions and is closely mapped to the requirements of the QMS. A TNA does not, and should not, imply that training will be the only solution. If training is not the solution, this will become apparent in the Scoping Exercise, after which, analysis activity will cease."

The principal activities of the TNA process, grouped together into the 3 Stages, are: TNA, Stage 1. Scoping Exercise Report.

Therefore, it can be argued that jobs (in the traditional sense of a person conducting a single task requiring a single skill, for example) seldom exist. Accordingly, it is more appropriate to analyse a Role that a person will fulfil. An example would be a RN Catering Services rating, who is trained in the primary Role but routinely has other Roles and duties aboard ship that are not related to the primary role (such as firefighting and First Aid). Training that person for the job of Catering Services/Fire Fighter/First Aider is impractical, but training that person for the primary Role , then the Role of fire fighter and the First Aider makes more sense. Thus RA is a more logical term than Job Analysis and more reflective of what this analysis actually does. Identification of Role"

Many tasks performed in Defence can be categorised as having a large physical component, e.g. stripping and assembling a weapon (discrete), flying an aircraft (continuous) and tying a bowline (discrete). Complex physical skills can often be broken down into smaller sub-skills, which can be learned separately and then put together for total performance. An example of this is swimming, which has 3 sub-skills (arm action, leg action and breathing technique), which can be learned and practised separately and then performed as one. More complex skills such as flying/driving, are similarly broken down into their component parts and taught as discrete skills in discrete lessons."

The identification of Standards relating to personal qualities and Attitudes is perhaps the most challenging part of the KSA Analysis.

Attitude is defined as a predisposition resulting in a tendency to act or react in a certain manner when confronted with another person, group, object, situation or idea. It is important to understand that this predisposition to think and feel in a certain way does not necessarily result in observable behaviours. An example of this could be an individual who holds an Attitude that all dogs are dangerous. However, this attitude may not be obvious to others when the individual is handling a dog with which they are familiar and have learned is friendly.

    "content": "The training environment and implications of location for each training solution may well require analysis at this stage. For example, constraints on training resources and the availability of real equipment for training may force the emphasis towards workplace training. The same would be true if it is not possible to replicate critical Role PS Conditions in training establishments or via distributed training. Alternatively expensive and scarce training equipment or qualified trainers may only be available in [some] training establishments. It is therefore important to determine an estimate of where the balance between training to be delivered in a training establishment and workplace training will fall. It is based on a careful analysis of exactly what the TRA requires, tempered by that which is deliverable and can only be achieved by consultation with the TRA and the Training Provider, who will have knowledge of existing training and current training facilities and resources. This will later result in the allocation of TOs to a TPS, WTS, or, where no training will take place, the Performance, Conditions and Standards to a RTGS32. The output from this work could be an amendment to the Initial Training Categories or recommendations that take account of both DIF Analysis results and the impact of all other Role, training and resource factors."

    "content": "Type of learning. The Method used to deliver training depends on whether learning is categorised as Knowledge, a mental or physical Skill, or an Attitude. Each EO must be examined to determine whether it is primarily expressed as a KSA. This will suggest the appropriate choice of Method (e.g. a Skills-based EO must have some element of practice involved in the Method; whilst role-play is an example of a training Method suitable for a Behaviour-based EO). The aim must be to choose a Method that is compatible with the material to be learned. Learning a physical Skill may require equipment and machinery and a low trainee-to-trainer ratio as it tends to be trainee-centric. Knowledge learning is most effective and efficient via e-learning, in the form of a lecture, or with links to information. This works best in a flipped classroom, where learning is then consolidated through discussion."

The appropriate selection of training Methods improves the effectiveness and efficiency of learning. Wherever possible, a learner-focused approach should be adopted although this is not always as simple as it seems as it can be time consuming and resource heavy. A learner-focused approach aids information retention by considering the needs of the trainees and increasing their involvement in the learning process. A trainer-focused approach, whilst increasing trainee-to-trainer ratios, is not as effective for aiding trainee retention. The more active the trainee is in the learning process, the higher the rate of retention."

Therefore, it is imperative that for the effective and efficient acquisition of the required KSA, time is built into the programme, to facilitate learning through reflection. People learn from reflecting on their own, or others experience. Therefore, enabling experiential learning is the most effective and efficient way of enabling learning. Trainee characteristics. Motivation. Learners are motivated to learn when they know the relevance of the learning, and when they are enabled to learn through a learner-centric way. For knowledge acquisition, motivation best comes through a flipped classroom, where the learners are required to access the learning (through e-learning for example) before they consolidate and reflect on what they have learnt, in the classroom."

The results of the DIF Analysis (1.3.3), the consideration of skill fade factors and/or the analysis of Critical Errors (1.3.3B) may have a significant influence on the Method selection.

CBA activity does not start at this stage of the TNA but the result of it is included in the Training Needs Report hence its inclusion here. Like many aspects of DSAT, CBA is an iterative process with initial activity commencing much earlier in the TNA process, as appropriate. The CBA will likely be further refined during the Method & Media selection process in Element 2 (Design).

Options Evaluation The final activity of the TNA is to decide on training options. To evaluate the merits of the training locations and/or environments one of them should be selected as a baseline option. The selection of a baseline will depend on the context, which then permits the construction of a table to display the relative merits of each option against the baseline. Options can be assessed via several criteria: The extent to which the option meets the requirements. Through-life cost 34 , including the costs of maintenance, trainers and integration with existing training locations/environments.
