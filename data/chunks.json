    "content": "A TNA is a structured analysis of training need arising as a result of new equipment acquisition, doctrinal change, organisational change, or changes to policy/legislation. It generally includes an analysis of different training Methods and technologies, with a view to recommending the optimum training solution which balances cost and quality. It is a highly flexible procedure with the choice of supporting tools and techniques to suit different Training Systems. In all cases, however, a TNA is an output based, iterative process that provides an audit trail for all decisions and is closely mapped to the requirements of the QMS. A TNA does not, and should not, imply that training will be the only solution. If training is not the solution, this will become apparent in the Scoping Exercise, after which, analysis activity will cease."

Many influencing factors, risks and assumptions are liable to change during the conduct of a TNA. It is therefore important that at every stage of a TNA, the key outputs are reviewed to ensure their continuing validity, and that stages of the process be repeated if necessary. Processes for reviewing the TNA outputs should be capable of amendment where changes are required. Tight control should be exercised by the TNASG, which approves all changes to the TNA. Follow-on changes to the training requirement and the impact on training may be managed through a system of configuration control but this does not remove the responsibility of the TNASG for ensuring that changes are reflected in the TNA."

Figure 2 illustrates the TSP in the wider TNA context. The TSP, governed by the TNASG should identify the milestones sufficient to meet the RFTD5. A RFTD should be considered at this stage, agreed and stated later as a ‘hard stop’ point, as part of the Training Authority Document (TrAD), which is produced at the end of Element 2 (Design)."

This is articulated in the Scoping Exercise Report. The scoping exercise should be completed as early as possible and starts by acquiring as much relevant information as possible about the training need and the Customer requirement. It defines the TNA management, risk, programming and resourcing within the boundaries of policy, assumptions and constraints. It also highlights issues that impact upon, or will need to be considered, during Stage 2. It will advise the TNA strategy for the proposed training solution and provide the parameters of the new or changed Defence requirement where TNAs will be, or have been, carried out. The scoping exercise does not have to be a long and protracted document and can utilise electronic references such as minutes of meetings, records of conversations to provide an auditable trail."

As this investigation progresses, decisions about how to apply the DSAT process should be made. For example, is it necessary to complete a full Role Analysis (RA) from first principles, or is it sufficient to confirm that an existing Role PS / Framework is still valid? Likewise, the strategy may recommend the process focuses on certain elements of a Role/task Performance which need further development or perhaps recommends targeting the TOs to ensure they support a Role PS and/or Framework. It may be decided that the sequence of training be reviewed if this is highlighted as a potential problem or that further consideration is given to current refresher training intervals. The scoping exercise should also cover a list of the resources required to complete the subsequent activities and an agreement as to which organisation(s) will provide them."

Therefore, it can be argued that jobs (in the traditional sense of a person conducting a single task requiring a single skill, for example) seldom exist. Accordingly, it is more appropriate to analyse a Role that a person will fulfil. An example would be a RN Catering Services rating, who is trained in the primary Role but routinely has other Roles and duties aboard ship that are not related to the primary role (such as firefighting and First Aid). Training that person for the job of Catering Services/Fire Fighter/First Aider is impractical, but training that person for the primary Role , then the Role of fire fighter and the First Aider makes more sense. Thus RA is a more logical term than Job Analysis and more reflective of what this analysis actually does."

They are overt and observable during their performance. Skills may be discrete (operate a switch) or continuous (fly/drive a vehicle). These skills are learned in connection with common activities such as using a computer, driving a car or playing a musical instrument. Many tasks performed in Defence can be categorised as having a large physical component, e.g. stripping and assembling a weapon (discrete), flying an aircraft (continuous) and tying a bowline (discrete). Complex physical skills can often be broken down into smaller sub-skills, which can be learned separately and then put together for total performance. An example of this is swimming, which has 3 sub-skills (arm action, leg action and breathing technique), which can be learned and practised separately and then performed as one. More complex skills such as flying/driving, are similarly broken down into their component parts and taught as discrete skills in discrete lessons."

The identification of Standards relating to personal qualities and Attitudes is perhaps the most challenging part of the KSA Analysis. This is because Attitudes cannot always be observed directly and hence the creation of definable standards can prove difficult. Attitude is defined as a predisposition resulting in a tendency to act or react in a certain manner when confronted with another person, group, object, situation or idea. It is important to understand that this predisposition to think and feel in a certain way does not necessarily result in observable behaviours. An example of this could be an individual who holds an Attitude that all dogs are dangerous. However, this attitude may not be obvious to others when the individual is handling a dog with which they are familiar and have learned is friendly.

A Behaviourally Anchored Rating Scale (BARS) is an example of a tool which can be used to assess observable behaviour objectively. Although a BARS (Table 3) can be used to measure attitude indirectly through observing behaviour, much care is needed when inferring Attitudes from observable behaviours alone. Attitudes may also be directly measured using validated questionnaires or other psychometric instruments21. Some examples are presented in Table 3.

Selection, development (including education) and training have key roles in growing necessary competencies and competences. Therefore, effective human capability development should not neglect either; instead, consideration of both will result in optimal requirement setting and solution development. Competence development (in the form of a Role PS and associated training solutions) is covered under the DSAT training analysis process contained within this policy. Furthermore, DSAT derived training solutions may either require some competencies as a pre-requisite or be developed during a training solution (often at the EO level)."

Where an external awarding body has already developed an appropriate competence framework (usually in the form of job-related standards/qualifications grouped under competence areas) it is acceptable within the DSAT process to utilise this, as appropriate, rather than developing bespoke a Role PS from scratch. This has the added benefit of easing the accreditation process and aiding skills transfer from both within Defence and externally (particularly during transition to civilian life). Furthermore, where similar competences are employed over a wide range of roles across Defence (e.g. more than one TLB), it may be appropriate to develop a competence"

Essentially, competency frameworks are a human resource tool and are generally used at organisational or functional level and can be used in selection, performance development and training. Competency frameworks are used to document required organisational behaviours, under grouped competency areas; such as Leadership, Communication, Problem-solving and Team-working. Where competency frameworks exist, it is acceptable to use them within DSAT, if the behavioural descriptors are appropriate within the context of Defence."

For example, constraints on training resources and the availability of real equipment for training may force the emphasis towards workplace training. The same would be true if it is not possible to replicate critical Role PS Conditions in training establishments or via distributed training. Alternatively expensive and scarce training equipment or qualified trainers may only be available in [some] training establishments. It is therefore important to determine an estimate of where the balance between training to be delivered in a training establishment and workplace training will fall. It is based on a careful analysis of exactly what the TRA requires, tempered by that which is deliverable and can only be achieved by consultation with the TRA and the Training Provider, who will have knowledge of existing training and current training facilities and resources. This will later result in the allocation of TOs to a TPS, WTS, or, where no training will take place, the Performance, Conditions and Standards to a RTGS32. The output from this work could be an amendment to the Initial Training Categories or recommendations that take account of both DIF Analysis results and the impact of all other Role, training and resource factors."

Each EO must be examined to determine whether it is primarily expressed as a KSA. This will suggest the appropriate choice of Method (e.g. a Skills-based EO must have some element of practice involved in the Method; whilst role-play is an example of a training Method suitable for a Behaviour-based EO). The aim must be to choose a Method that is compatible with the material to be learned. Learning a physical Skill may require equipment and machinery and a low trainee-to-trainer ratio as it tends to be trainee-centric. Knowledge learning is most effective and efficient via e-learning, in the form of a lecture, or with links to information.

A learner-focused approach aids information retention by considering the needs of the trainees and increasing their involvement in the learning process.

The respondents’ right to privacy and the right to refuse to answer certain questions, or to be interviewed at all, should always be respected, and no undue pressure should be brought to bear. The reason for this caution whilst undertaking data collection is not only for the interviewee’s benefit but also for the interviewer’s. If an interviewee believes that answering questions honestly will harm them then they are more likely to give bland, misleading and uninformative answers. Any evaluation based on such data is invalid. When conducting interviews a manner conducive to following sound ethical considerations should be followed. Examples are:"

It is then appropriate for the interviewer to indicate how the answer has been recorded (e.g. “Am I right in putting you down as saying?”). This gives the respondent time to think again and for the interviewer to check that what has been said has really been understood. If the answer does not fit under an already accepted heading then it must be inserted under a new heading, which will in turn be available for all subsequent interviews.

They can be extremely time-consuming, hence they may be used to clarify issues raised from questionnaires for relatively small numbers. A structure must be developed (see Interview Schedule below) to record the strength of opinions given. Interviewers and those analysing the data need to be trained if similar opinions are to be rated by different individuals. Once achieved, information obtained from different interviewers can be compared:"

However, with qualitative data there may be trends (patterns, themes) present, which could go unnoticed. One of the problems of dealing with qualitative data is the ‘blizzard of information’ that can be reproduced. This can often be unstructured in content and resource intensive in terms of workforce and time to analyse. Such considerations need to be included during initial project management planning. In analysing qualitative data the quality of the analyst must be taken into consideration, as unlike quantitative data analysis where the issues are more readily identifiable, qualitative analysis requires greater degree(s) of interpretation. Analysts must be conscious of the possibility of knee jerk reactions when confronting data for the first time"

Triangulation is the combination of different data gathering techniques to investigate the same issue and will usually combine both quantitative and qualitative data methods. For example, rather than simply completing a questionnaire in respect of how an individual performs a task, they might also be interviewed and observed conducting the task. The use of questionnaires together with observation, or qualitative with quantitative data gathering techniques, for example, can reduce the chance of distorting the results or introducing bias within the methodology. To that end triangulation allows greater confidence in the research results regardless of the data gathering methodologies applied."

A TNA is a structured analysis of training need arising as a result of new equipment acquisition, doctrinal change, organisational change, or changes to policy/legislation It is a highly flexible procedure with the choice of supporting tools and techniques to suit different Training Systems. It typically includes an analysis of different training Methods and technologies, with a view to recommending the optimum training solution to meet Defence needs and which balances cost and quality.   In all cases, however, a TNA is an output based, iterative process that provides an audit trail for all decisions and is closely mapped to the requirements of the QMS.  A TNA does not, and should not, imply that training will be the only solution.  If training is not the solution, this will become apparent in the Planning Stage, after which, analysis activity will cease.

Whether in the workplace or a training establishment, the underlying principles and standards for the delivery of Defence training remain the same. Training provision is the process conducted by the Training Provider that enables and allows trainees to learn.

Undue pressure should not be put on managers or those delivering training to deviate from planned and endorsed training programmes. Those responsible for the management and delivery of training should have the ability to amend training as necessary, to meet changing environmental conditions (e.g. avoiding excessive heat), equipment deficiencies or shortfalls in resources. However, careful consideration must be given to the resultant risk, especially where it has an impact on safety that increases the risk to life and could result in death or serious injury. It is imperative that the delivery of training remains progressive and subject to a safe system of training throughout. Changes to planned training delivery such as truncating, accelerating or other variations (changing location, time or content etc) can affect the rate at which training proficiency is achieved, potentially increasing the associated risk. In many cases certain proficiency criteria must be met by trainees to be able to perform tasks in a consistent, reliable and repeatable manner that meets established standards, facilitating the progression in training and enabling post training activities. This is of paramount importance for any critical training which, if not conducted to the correct standard, increases the risk to life and could result in death or serious injury. Any change to the content, time or resources available for such critical training must be subject to an approved risk assessment by the Commander, Line Manager or accountable person."

The effectiveness of training delivery will be measured by the Training Provider and appropriate governance body according to whether the intended outcomes (the TOs) have been achieved successfully.

Managing risks to the trained output (i.e. the KSA of the trainees undergoing individual training) is different from assessing and managing risks associated with the Training System.  The responsibility for the management of training deficiency lies with the Training Provider.  Where risks or issues resulting from identified training deficiencies cannot be mitigated by the Training Provider, such training deficiency-based risks should be elevated for treatment or toleration etc.  Identifying and raising training deficiencies shows the stakeholders where training shortfalls exist or where risks have been taken owing to either an inability to train certain TOs (due to weather constraints or equipment casualties, for example) or a training failure that has been picked up through the assurance process.  Such deficiencies suggest that trainees may not hold the competences that the training should have delivered.  These are essentially unplanned but unavoidable training gaps which should therefore be captured, and the appropriate governance body informed so that a decision can be made to treat, tolerate or transfer (to the receiving unit) the training deficiency. A Training Deficiency is not the same as the Residual Training Gap.  The Residual Training Gap is agreed by the TRA early on in the DSAT process and is articulated in the RTGS."

The problem may manifest itself as a skills or knowledge deficiency while the underlying cause is an attitudinal one, and vice-versa.  A trainer’s judgement is critical in determining the underlying cause and then deciding on the appropriate remedy.  Many factors must be considered, including the stage of training, the seriousness of the problem, and the performance to date of the recruit or trainee.  It is vital that trainers apply their experience and judgement to the analysis of the problem, to determine what action must be taken, including encouragement and reassurance if considered more appropriate than RT."

It is deliberately designed to induce an element of pressure in order to challenge recruits and trainees mentally and physically, so that they draw on reserves of willpower and stamina to achieve the outcome sought.  The aim therefore of Robust Training events is to develop physical and mental resilience in order to prepare appropriately for the challenges of operations worldwide.  It is entirely practical to deliver such training without compromising welfare and Duty of Care responsibilities, but it must be regulated to prevent Robust Training being replaced with harsh or inappropriate training that prevents the overall training effect from being delivered."

The purpose of Robust Training is to progressively develop a Service Person’s (SPs) resilience to enable them to perform effectively in any operational environment.  The degree to which Robust Training is employed within an Initial training programme should reflect the employment of that SP in both specialist and generic tasks.  Emphasis should be placed upon the need for SP to perform in the most demanding conditions in which they may realistically expect to find themselves if deployed to high-tempo and/or high-threat operational environments.  As Defence transitions to a contingent posture, the non-linear nature of the Contemporary Operating Environment (COE) will inevitably expose SP from support functions to higher risks than would have traditionally been the case.  It is therefore no longer acceptable to have a situation where combat personnel and support or service support personnel sit at distant ends of a wide spectrum of individual resilience.  This gap should be narrowed if all SP are to be best prepared for operational service.  This requires moral courage to implement and there is a need for a coherence of approach across Defence and single Service (sS) training establishments to ensure that Robust Training is systematic, progressive and appropriately contextualised."

Training to meet the needs of military Service, which stretches recruits and trainees physically and psychologically, ideally under simulated operational conditions, is likely to carry more training risk than is normally the case.  Commanders and training staff must ensure that all risks are assessed and mitigated, but they must not seek to unnecessarily protect recruits and trainees from the consequence of failing to rise to the challenges set.  It is acknowledged that this element will need to draw upon the experience and judgement of the training Chain of Command.  It is vital to avoid the inculcation of a culture of risk aversion that may lead to the physical or psychological inability to perform adequately when facing the challenge of operational conditions."

It is important that training staff designing and delivering Robust Training must ensure that recruits and trainees as well as training staff understand the purpose and intended outcome of the training.  It must be clearly differentiated from any sort of remedial training, corrective or disciplinary action.  Training that is intended to be robust must not be confused with any form of bullying, harassment or intimidation.  Such conduct is wholly unacceptable and contrary to Defence’s Values, Standards and Ethos and the DHALI/B intent, and is demonstrably counter-productive in developing resilience.  Effective supervisory care, welfare policies and governance and assurance processes will ensure that Robust Training is not confused with, or replaced by, actions or events that either serve a different remedial, corrective or disciplinary purpose, or those that are conducted in a misguided attempt to achieve unsanctioned, unacceptable and unnecessary outcomes."

It is possible to prevent confusion amongst recruits and trainees by detailed explanation of Robust Training aims and objectives during induction and regularly thereafter.  Trainers must have the principles of Robust Training explained to them during their selection, training and again when they join the training establishment.  Where inexperienced staff or trainers are expected to apply Robust Training techniques they must be mentored and supervised."

The most common adaptation of approach is when the change to the operational requirement is small or where there is perhaps no/minimal change to the RPS. Typical examples are equipment updates which result in changes to maintenance routines and, for efficiency purposes, the proposal of alternative learning strategies involving new training methods and media. For these types of capture, an evaluation of training requirement is recommended which replaces deliverables 1 and 2. The training options analysis will then follow. The detailed strategy shall be determined as part of the scoping exercise for each individual project"

The rationale for this is that it may be many years after the final report is endorsed before we are in a position to evaluate the proposed solution. Implementation and management of the TNE will depend upon the nature of the project, which will have been recommended by the TNA final report."

The outputs to be delivered from the TNA process should be agreed at the scoping phase and the analysts can then select the correct approach and tools based on the constraints and information available at the time. Analysis should not be conducted as a check list exercise: it uses thought processes and deduction to reach sensible recommendations. Analysis should only be undertaken if it adds value to the TNA. Early setup and consultation with the TGS and its key stakeholder members including TNA QA and TRA will allow the optimum approach to be identified and endorsed."

SME support can be drawn from a variety of sources including: Operational Command (end user); policy; organisational headquarters; equipment manufacturer; users of the equipment/system; training staff; training equipment companies; CBT designers. In most cases SMEs are not exclusively tasked to provide advice and support. When collecting data and validating analysis the analyst should consider time, location, and the accessibility of SMEs to make the most efficient use of these valuable resources. Workshops, meetings, e-mails and telephone conversations form the normal correspondence. The selection of SMEs may vary during the different phases of the TNA."

The results of a KSA Analysis contribute to the generation of TOs and EOs, judgement of the most cost-effective Training Options and the selection of the most appropriate training Methods & Media. Judgement should be applied to ensure large swathes of trivial KSA are not listed and that KSA are identified with a suitable level of precision to enable the development of performable TOs/EOs.

Typically, capital costs should include new building, training equipment/GFE (including installation), extra computer hardware/software, courseware development and new training aids. This figure is normally a one off initial payment but there may be periodic renewable elements across the TLC."

    "content": "The CRA-T approach has been updated to allow combinations and integrations of knowledge and skills to be considered. The original approach involved decomposing a task into subtasks and identifying the ‘predominant psychological domain’ for each subtask. This approach failed to acknowledge that the predominant domain is not always that which is most susceptible to skill fade. It also prevented identification of where combinations of two or more domains underpin subtasks or where skills are integrated. In this handbook, CRA now requires decomposition of a task/Training Objective (TO) into subtasks/Enabling Objectives (EOs) and task elements/Key Learning Points (KLPs). Decomposing tasks down to the task element/KLP level enables a detailed identification of the knowledge and skills needed for an adequate understanding of the task. By doing so, it becomes possible to identify the psychological domain most susceptible to decay and map that to the subtask/EO, rather than the predominant domain."

Therefore, the CRA-T cannot be used to identify the point at which an individual’s task performance would fall below a set level. ‘The Predictive Performance Equation (PPE)’, is a potential alternative to CRA (Peebles, 2020). The PPE can predict individual performance over periods ranging from days to months and can therefore support training designers in tailoring refresher training to an individual’s particular requirements. Application of the PPE is likely to be most suitable for specialised training courses, where an understanding of individual requirements for refresher training is needed. See Peebles (2020) for information on the type of training or performance data that is required to make use of the PPE."

The retention levels are categorised into a practical traffic light system of three retention levels: GREEN (High Retention: 12 months), AMBER (Moderate Retention: 5 months) and RED (Low Retention: 2 months). GREY (Not Known) is used for implicit knowledge and the complex cognitive psychological skill domains, as a retention level cannot yet be assigned due to insufficient scientific evidence. Although insufficient, the available evidence suggests implicit knowledge and complex cognitive skills are retained for 6 months."

For example, ‘Manage’ could indicate the Procedural skills or Simple Decision-making skills domain. Therefore, Subject Matter Expert (SME) knowledge of the task/job role is needed in order to best match task elements/KLPs and subtasks/EOs to the psychological domains. In some cases, it may also be necessary to look at the steps (i.e., the next level of granularity below the task element/KLP) to better inform understanding of the domains required at the task element/KLP level."

    "content": "The acquisition and retention of implicit knowledge and complex cognitive skills that underpin complex tasks is enhanced by the development of a strong mental model. A mental model is a mental representation of a task, which captures how it is understood or conceptualised and performed. It includes an understanding of the task components and the purpose(s) of the whole task and its subtasks/EOs, the conceptual relationships between subtasks/EOs, and how they work together during performance of the whole task. Developing a strong mental model is a key factor influencing the acquisition and retention of implicit knowledge and complex cognitive skills. This is because a strong mental model provides the conceptual ‘glue’ required to bind subtask/EO components (i.e., task elements/KLPs) in long-term memory. It also aids the encoding of task complexity. The positive effect on retention of the other influencing factors summarised in Table 14, is dependent on the acquisition of a strong mental model."

The more complex the task, the more important it is for the mind to be able to develop, retain and update the mental model for the task. In general, individuals are not conscious of their task mental models and do not explicitly articulate them. However, mental models for any task can be explicitly articulated through analysis to identify what has to be learned. By analysing the mental model, the conceptual relationships between the subtasks/EOs can be identified. These can then be specified as additional KLPs and incorporated into the training design and delivery. It is important to note that these KLPs would not have been identified using traditional KSA analysis techniques."

Having identified the complexity of the task, training can be designed to support acquisition and retention of complex tasks.

Such discrete subtasks/EOs can be performed in isolation from each other and there are no conceptual relationships between them. For example, Figure 4 shows the simple task of ‘Ironing a shirt’. Here, there is a single relationship (i.e., link) radiating out from the whole task to each subtask/EO. To illustrate, setting up the ironing equipment can be conducted independently of thinking about the other subtasks/EOs. Mental models for simple tasks do not need to be made explicit during training. This is because the retention of simple tasks is determined by working memory capacity i.e., memory for procedurals and/or stepped decisional processes."

The subtasks/EOs of complex tasks can be performed separately or concurrently, but conceptual relationships will exist between two or more of the subtasks/EOs. Complex tasks require the acquisition of a strong and flexible (i.e., adaptable) mental model. To support acquisition and retention of a complex task, it is important for training designers to explicitly specify this task mental model. This can be done by developing an external representation, which illustrates the conceptual understanding that has to be developed in the learner through practice. This then allows the training designer to identify the conceptual learning points which will support subconscious acquisition of the task mental model."

For example, the subtask/EO of Conduct Project Planning is an essential part of a bathroom renovation and begins with the setting the budget (i.e., sequencing) and its ongoing management as the project evolves. Ongoing management requires coordination in terms of timing (budget usually comes first). Managing the Budget is dependent on ongoing adjustments to the project plan, resulting from changes in other subtasks/EO. For example, it may be necessary to cancel the purchase of previously selected materials due to unforeseen delays in the supply chain. Updating the budget as a result of changes to the plan is likely to be frequent, given the component complexity."

With reference to the key to symbols for dimensions of complexity in Table 15, this type of circle and arrow indicates that dynamic complexity is low for this task. There are few expected input/output changes to one or more subtasks/EOs. Thus, the impact on whole task performance resulting from an increase in cognitive demand is correspondingly low. An example of an input change to the ‘Select Tradespersons’ subtask/EO would be where a tradesperson is no longer available. This would result in an adjustment (i.e., output change) to the ‘Conduct Project Planning’ subtask/EO. However, if more dynamic input/output changes to one or more subtasks/EOs were to be expected, the task mental model could be adjusted by using the symbol for high dynamic complexity (see Table 15)."

    "content": "In Figure 6, the outer circle surrounding the task and subtasks/EOs comprises a solid line with three arrows pointing towards the task. As can be seen from the key in Table 15, the dynamic complexity for this task is high. It is highly likely that there will be multiple input/output changes to one or more subtasks/EOs. An example of an input change to the ‘React to environmental impact’ subtask/EO would be where an unpredicted impact on the environment is identified by the incident commander (e.g., hazardous cargo exploding). This would result in an adjustment (i.e., output change) to the ‘Liaise with other agencies’ subtask/EO. Thus, the impact on whole task performance resulting from an increase in cognitive demand is correspondingly high."

    "content": "To enable acquisition of complex tasks, the level of dynamic complexity should be designed into task exercises. Where a task mental model indicates high dynamic complexity, training designers and deliverers should ensure that learners practise responding to multiple dynamic (i.e., unpredictable) input/output changes to one or more subtasks/EOs. Conversely, where low dynamic complexity is indicated, training designers and deliverers should build in some dynamic input/output changes to one or more subtasks/EOs. This will exercise the conceptual relationships between the subtasks/EOs. By building in authentic, meaningful, varied, and unpredictable task inputs/outputs, training designers and deliverers will ensure the conceptual relationships between the subtasks/EOs are strongly bound in memory. How well complex cognitive tasks are acquired and retained is inferred from whole task performance and not the ability of trainees to describe or repeat the structure of the task mental model."

Next, links should be drawn between the subtasks/EOs to explicitly represent the task’s coordinative complexity and define the conceptual relationships, i.e., what conceptually ‘glues’ the sub-tasks/EOs together. The conceptual relationships will either be coordinated (but not integrated) or integrated (i.e., performed concurrently). An outer circle should then be drawn, with the line of the circle and arrows representative of the task’s dynamic complexity and thus the likely occurrence of dynamic input/output changes to one or more subtasks/EOs that may impact whole task performance.

For example, where integrated conceptual relationships have been identified between all subtasks/EOs because these are matched to the Integrative domain, then the complex task is fully integrated. Consequently, all subtasks/EOs should be brought together and practised and assessed as a whole task. This ensures the conceptual integrative ‘glue’, essential for the effective integration and coordination of the other psychological skills underpinning task elements/KLPs, is fully integrated into the training programme. However, if a complex task is only partially integrated, where some but not all subtasks/EOs are matched to the integrative domain, then it may be possible for some subtasks/EOs to be practised and assessed at the part task level."

The low (RED), moderate (AMBER) and high (GREEN) retention levels should be considered as indicative of when refresher training is required and not conclusive. This is because the CRA-T is based on the UDA predictive skills retention model, which was originally developed for tasks requiring the recall of procedures and stepped processes. In addition, although this predictive skills retention model has received some validation, it has not been widely validated and is known to be pessimistic. In general, the UDA predicts on average a smaller percentage of a workforce will be competent than the actual performance data would suggest. For some tasks, this difference has been as large as 30% (Rose, Czarnolewski et al., 1985)."

Although the UDA is based on task-related factors that are known to influence the retention of explicit knowledge, physical and simple cognitive skills, the algorithm applied in the generation of its decay curves is based on the aggregation of individual performance data. Therefore, the decay curves represent the percentage of a workforce predicted to remain proficient after a period of time has elapsed since the knowledge or skill was last applied. Given the CRA-T extant retention levels are based on UDA-generated retention curves, they do not indicate knowledge and skill fade at the level of the individual. It follows that the CRA-T retention levels cannot be used to identify the point at which an individual’s performance would fall below criterion."

They also assume that the workforce has received the same training, to the same standard, and that personnel meet the same level of proficiency at the time of skill acquisition. To address these limitations, new decay explanations of knowledge and skills retention must be based on individual retention of acquired knowledge and skills over an extended period of non-use. Key to the generation of individual skills retention curves is the requirement for a standardised approach where the same individuals: i) are at or above a criterion performance level; ii) have had equivalent training experience during acquisition; and iii) have been assessed at the point of acquisition and after a specified retent ion interval(s). Guidance for the collection of longitudinal empirical evidence is covered in a Top Tips document for the Planning, Conduct and Analysis of Future skill Fade research (Cahillane & Anderson, 2021)."

The re- classification of KSA in terms of the psychological knowledge and skill domains outlines knowledge, skills and attitudes in a manner that is consistent with advances in the psychological literature on human cognition (Green & Bavelier, 2015; Sanli & Carnaham, 2018; Stasielowicz, 2019). There are no attitudinal domains because attitudes do not decay over time. Nevertheless, there is a relationship between attitudes and skills retention, hence the taxonomy’s acknowledgement of Attitudes."

For example, when faced with complex situations, firefighters and incident commanders do not consciously articulate the knowledge they are using because it is implicit.

Simple cognitive skills include the Procedural skills domain, which represents the ability to remember a sequence of steps and their order to execute a task. There are minimal physical demands. For example, when using a BIMS to create map overlays, the physical component only constitutes using a mouse and the procedural aspect dominates. This distinguishes procedural skills from discrete psychomotor skills such as weapon handling, which have greater physical demands and require the recall of a sequence of actions. Simple Decision-making involves a series of processes involving analysis and evaluation with discrete outputs that have a definite beginning and end and result in a decision. The options available during a simple decision- making process are usually binary, such as 'Yes' and ‘No’ when a decision tree is followed, for example, combat casualty drills."

    "content": "The Integrative domain is a complex cognitive (i.e., mental) ‘meta-skill’. It sits above the other skill domains and represents the ability of an individual to manage their attention in order to perform within two or more different psychological skill domains concurrently. The Integrative domain is required for subtasks where the task elements match a combination of two or more different psychological skill domains that are performed concurrently (i.e., integrated). An example is a firefighter responsible for responding to an incident (simple decision-making) and deciding what and how information should be communicated to multiple agencies (complex decision-making), whilst managing events immediate to the scene of a fire (procedural skills). Note that the procedural skills and discrete psychomotor skills cannot be integrated (i.e., performed concurrently). This because discrete psychomotor skills involve the recall of a sequence of motor actions. Hence, higher motor demands are combined with moderate cognitive demands (i.e., procedural skill). An example of two simple cognitive skills that might be performed concurrently (i.e., integrated) are continuous psychomotor and adaptive cognition, for example, a UAS pilot having to adapt their thinking in order to drive behavioural, i.e., continuous psychomotor output. The UAS pilot has to adapt to constant changes in the information being fed back to them by the sensors, which they are simultaneously controlling."

    "content": "Capability is not just a function of equipment performance, but depends on a combination of interacting elements. Some of the most difficult issues to address lie in the Human Component of Capability. The equipment and systems have to be operated in a demanding and diverse military context in circumstances of fatigue, hunger, stress and even fear. Ultimately their usability in these demanding environments will determine our operational success. The types of equipment and systems we are now specifying and procuring will also shape the roles, responsibilities and career paths of future service personnel who we recruit, and our ability to retain them."

    "content": "Approaching our Defence needs from a capability direction, rather than a platform, system or equipment one, heightens the need for Human Factors Integration (HFI) of Defence systems. We must set out to deliver solutions that enhance our capability aspirations with a more sophisticated understanding of the role of people in the operation, maintenance and support of our future systems. The challenge is to integrate the people provided by the Armed Forces (including Reservists), with the equipment developed by industry and delivered by the Ministry of Defence, in a way that maximises capability within the real operational environment."

    "content": "The terms ‘Human Factors (HF)’, ‘Human Factors Engineering (HFE)’ and ‘Human Factors Integration’ are often confused. ‘Human Factors’ refers to a range of disciplines (principally scientific), which relate to the study of human capabilities, limitations, characteristics and behaviour in the broadest possible sense. It includes the study of human interactions with technologies and social interactions and draws on many scientific disciplines, including ergonomics, psychology (and neuropsychology), physiology, biology, anthropometry and biomechanics. It provides the knowledge base from which Human Factors Engineering draws. HFE is concerned with the application of this knowledge in the design, development, assessment, fielding, in-service support and disposal of products – equipment, sub-systems, systems and platforms. In contrast, HFI is a management activity, which includes a systematic process for identifying, tracking and resolving people-related considerations (especially risks and issues), to ensure a balanced development of both technological and human aspects of capability."

This provides information on the resources used for training, with a forward projection of resource requirements and, potentially, costs. An important aspect of the Templates module is that it enables the capture of information necessary to improve management of resources, balancing their use to achieve greater efficiency. Templates also provide links into courses to automate InVal. As a minimum, Training Providers are to show each course in sufficient detail to support an accurate assessment of the utilisation of trainers and those key resources with a significant associated cost. The design of courses that call on several different, costly resource types for different lessons/events will need to be prioritised for production in more detail.

The MTAO is part of the FT team and comprises training specialists embedded at MOD Abbey Wood (as a team and singleton posts within specific project teams) and is charged with delivering specialist training support, advice, guidance and direction to project teams and capability sponsors to ensure that the training and personnel implications of DE&S, Defence Digital and SDA decisions are considered as an integrated component of project team work and at the earliest opportunity. From 1 Apr 23 further Directorate P&T Org design will split these teams, with a new OF5 SM Coherence being created and taking on the SM related elements of Future Training and MTAO."

The single key factor that drives a successful project is the formation of a Training Steering Group (TSG) at the earliest opportunity within the Concept phase of the CADMID cycle. The TSG’s primary purpose is the management of the integration of Training within the project and is overseen by the Chairman from the PT who is to ensure that all the appropriate stakeholders are identified and actively engaged in the process (see Annex E). This is done through regular TSG meetings where deliverable timelines are agreed, stakeholder feedback coordinated and regular communication with the PT maintained to ensure they remain aware of projects progress. Cross-DLOD issues identified at the TSG will be raised up to the Capability Integration WG and potentially the Programme Board (PgB)."

An agile force is one whose people learn continuously, from experience and from each other, as well as from training courses. Learning in the workplace is just as important as learning on a course and requires the support of qualified trainers. Whether in the workplace or a training establishment, the underlying principles and standards for the delivery of Defence training remain the same. Training provision is the process conducted by the Training Provider that enables and allows trainees to learn. It is the outputs that ensure trainers are trained, learning activities are piloted, programmed and resourced, learning is prepared for, training deficiencies are managed, risks are assessed and trainees are appropriately cared for."

Trainees who self-regulate their learning are motivated to learn through-life and are confident of their ability to learn, and so they are more likely to take action to remain competent and current in their job role. Trainers can teach trainees to self-regulate by prompting them to set and reflect on individual goals, using feedback to then identify and review what they did to achieve the goal. Concentrating more on what the trainee did (or did not do), rather than the actual outcome, helps to develop these self-monitoring capabilities.

Trainers must assess all of the EOs and KLPs as specified in the ASpec and not make any changes that alter these. The manner in which the assessment is conducted is determined by the ASpec.

Well-designed training, however, can still fail if it is not delivered in the way it was intended. Training deliverers must therefore comply with the specifications of the training design when they deliver their lessons. The DTCF sets out the requirement for trainers to employ “relevant DSAT course documentation to identify desired learning outcomes and plan collective learning events” in Competency 2.1 and to adapt “delivery according to trainee response while still achieving planned outcomes” in Competency 4.1.

Once training activities are programmed the elements should be sequenced, or scheduled, in order that the training is conducted in the correct order to optimise both the acquisition and retention of the KSA. This ensures that training is built up and TOs and their dependent EOs and KLPs are delivered in the order that maintains the integrity of their dependencies (i.e. that the achievement of a TO may require dependent EOs/KLPs to be conducted in a particular sequence in order to ensure that the trainees’ KSA is built up progressively). This, however, may not always be necessary. The course schedule or programme is usually produced by the Course Design Cell as part of the course documentation. Particularly in larger training organisations, it is essential that trainers stick to the planned course schedule, as resources and classrooms will need to be carefully managed to meet the needs of a high number of trainees and different courses. Where there is a need to change the course schedule, this should always be approved by the course manager and trainers should aim to avoid short notice changes wherever possible."

In the context of the DTC, the role of the DTM and DTS, in particular, is critical in creating and maintaining this culture of continuous improvement, by promoting the adoption of good practice, the exploitation of learning technologies and the provision of CPD at all levels. That said, all training staff should be made aware of their role in the continuous improvement process."

Trainers should always use an up to date ASpec when planning an assessment. The main purpose of the ASpec is to control what is assessed and how. It is important Trainers assess all of the EOs and KLPs as specified in the ASpec and not make any changes that alter these. The manner in which the assessment is conducted is determined by the ASpec. Designers strive to provide as much realism as possible, sometimes by using simulation, instrumented or scenario-based activities and so unauthorised changes to the realism of a practical assessment may make it invalid. If limited resources make it difficult to deliver the assessment in the recommended way or the ASpec appears too restrictive, the DTS, DTM or Chain of Command should be informed."

    "content": "The purpose of using coaching techniques is to unlock a trainee’s potential in order to improve and maximise performance. It is about helping trainees learn for themselves rather than delivering training to them. Coaching techniques form an integral part of the trainer’s toolbox. Everything should be geared towards ensuring that trainees are successful. Often that simply means responding positively and constructively to their efforts and setting new challenges for them. There will also be times when a more focused individual approach is needed (e.g. to develop a trainee who is struggling, or to motivate a trainee who is finding training too easy). Coaching techniques form the basis of the Defence trainer course, and of learner-centric training, in order to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of training are maximised."

Each has different aims. Where mentoring is mentioned in this JSP, it is referring primarily to the Role of the Defence Trainer Supervisor (DTS) who acts as a mentor for Trainers. In the DTS context the definition of Mentoring is: ‘where a trusted colleague shares knowledge and experience over a period of time to assist a new colleague’."

It is a combination of firm discipline, high quality rigorous training, maintenance of high standards, a sense of fair play, treating the trainee as an individual and encouraging people to achieve tasks and skills far beyond those that they first thought themselves capable of. Training is successful if it results in a high level of skill, self-discipline, initiative and obedience to orders in the moment of crisis. Successful training also delivers independent learners, who are motivated to continue to learn through life and thus are able to deal with the complex, the uncertain and the unexpected."

This will suggest the appropriate choice of Method (e.g. a Skills-based EO must have some element of practice involved in the Method; whilst role-play is an example of a training Method suitable for a Behaviour-based EO). The aim must be to choose a Method that is compatible with the material to be learned. Learning a physical Skill may require equipment and machinery and a low trainee-to-trainer ratio as it tends to be trainee-centric. Knowledge learning is most effective and efficient via e-learning, in the form of a lecture, or with links to information.

An MTS is an iterative mechanism (supported by documented products and processes) to ensure that the training being delivered remains meaningful and continues to contribute to delivering Defence effect.

Defence people work in hazardous environments, under stressful conditions whilst conducting activities that carry a high risk to personal safety. Consequently, Defence must ensure that its Training Systems meet the very highest standards. Training must also be robust, realistic, and challenging if it is to prepare its personnel for the full spectrum of Defence Roles. However, there is a tendency, because of the risk, for Defence training organisations to provide more training than necessary in the misguided belief that this will make up for future uncertainties. And, in some cases, poorly designed or executed Training Systems can deliver insufficient training. The ideal then is a Training System that is designed to train its personnel to an optimal level so that they are equipped with the appropriate Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes (KSA). Providing too much training costs money that will likely be taken from elsewhere in the training budget that could then result in insufficient training in other areas, which risks lives. Therefore, a Training System designed using a common process and that is governed and managed in accordance with the Defence mandated QMS, is vital to ensure that Defence people are best equipped to achieve Defence effect."

    "content": "Training should be delivered as it was planned, with the correct training facilities, suitably qualified and experienced training staff and with the correct procedures and instructions. Undue pressure should not be put on managers or those delivering training to deviate from planned and endorsed training programmes. Those responsible for the management and delivery of training should have the ability to amend training as necessary, to meet changing environmental conditions (e.g. avoiding excessive heat), equipment deficiencies or shortfalls in resources. However, careful consideration must be given to the resultant risk, especially where it has an impact on safety that increases the risk to life and could result in death or serious injury. It is imperative that the delivery of training remains progressive and subject to a safe system of training throughout. Changes to planned training delivery such as truncating, accelerating or other variations (changing location, time, or content etc) can affect the rate at which training proficiency is achieved, potentially increasing the associated risk. In many cases certain proficiency criteria must be met by trainees to be able to perform tasks in a consistent, reliable, and repeatable manner that meets established standards, facilitating the progression in training and enabling post training activities. This is of paramount importance for any critical training which, if not conducted to the correct standard, increases the risk to life and could result in death or serious injury. Any change to the content, time, or resources available for such critical training must be subject to an approved risk assessment by the Commander, Line Manager or accountable person."

    "content": "It is not sufficient to merely monitor risks, but all involved must be aware of the possibility and impact of cumulative risk. This may occur within a training day or training course as activities are changed and amended, with the trainer or supervisor required to keep track of the impact on safety as well as the training standard and welfare of all those involved. Cumulative risk incorporates other areas such as support and management, where there is no longer the capacity to maintain the existing training or update it to meet changing requirements (e.g. input standards) or fully implement the recommendations from reviews. For example, the informal act of a changing task (change in task complexity, omitting a particular step, changing the conditions set out in the planned activity) - although necessary, may have introduced additional risks that were not recognised- either in facilitating training, or in the need for suitable progression for the trainees. In addition, gapping in the training support area may mean this change is never updated in the DSAT mandated documentation and hence it is not reviewed and authorised. Operational pressures and resource constraints may then mean this shortfall is continually repeated in several areas and informal changes become normalised: the training delivered may be required but does not match the authorised and documented instructions and procedures being managed and resourced. Such cumulative risk must be recognised, escalated through the chain of command, and actioned as necessary."
