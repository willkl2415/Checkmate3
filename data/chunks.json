    "content": "1. A TNA is a structured analysis of training need arising as a result of new equipment acquisition, doctrinal change, organisational change, or changes to policy/legislation. It generally includes an analysis of different training Methods and technologies, with a view to recommending the optimum training solution which balances cost and quality. It is a highly flexible procedure with the choice of supporting tools and techniques to suit different Training Systems. In all cases, however, a TNA is an output based, iterative process that provides an audit trail for all decisions and is closely mapped to the requirements of the QMS. A TNA does not, and should not, imply that training will be the only solution. If training is not the solution, this will become apparent in the Scoping Exercise, after which, analysis activity will cease. 1. The TNA provides an audit trail of analysis to determine the need for training and, if required, enable design of a training solution. The process described below is a 3-stage process with a number of specified outputs. However, it should be emphasised that this recommended approach is not necessarily linear nor does it have to be followed prescriptively. In many cases there may not be a requirement to produce all of the suggested output products, and there may be merit in conducting stages or activities concurrently."

The TOA considers each relevant Task in the Role PS / Competence Framework to assess the extent to which the training environment should replicate the workplace (real) environment to enable training to be effective. This is known as the Fidelity Analysis. The implications of locations and environment for training and Methods & Media options are then considered. The key outputs are the realistic options for Methods & Media and refinement (based upon fidelity, locations and environment) of the possible training solutions. Cost-effective options which take account of Whole Life training requirements (including refresher training) are considered. (5) Training Needs Report (TNR). The Training Needs Report analyses the cost benefits and then evaluates the merits of the training options, before confirming the TNASG endorsed training solution. The report includes the Role PS and/or Framework(s). The key output is a recommendation as to the most cost-effective training solution, which inputs into the SOTR. An implementation plan is also included."

The TNE is conducted in 2 parts: evaluation of the process, and evaluation of the training solution. The key output is an assessment of how well the TNA outputs contributed to the provision of a training solution that meets the Defence requirement. This completes the TNA process. TNE is covered in DTSM 5. 3. Why or when should a TNA be conducted? Before a TNA can begin, a clear evidence-based Statement of Requirement (SoR) is to be produced, preferably in a written format (letter, e-mail, request form or tasking order, for example). Then, prior to the commencement of the analysis, a scoping exercise is conducted which may identify that the most cost-effective means of achieving the required Defence need, is a training solution2. Once the requirement for training has been established, a TNA should be undertaken to ascertain the type and scope of the training requirement that meets the Defence need. It should be noted that a TNA may range from a simple interview to a process lasting several months. See DTSM 1 for more information on a SoR."

    "content": "8. Non-training specialist involvement in a TNA. Stakeholders often have a limited knowledge of the MTS and are unfamiliar with the TNA process. At the start of a TNA, time is often well spent in educating those who are to be involved in the TNA about the process. They should be aware of their responsibilities, including the provision of information and staffing routines. Whilst it is not usually the TNA author s responsibility to the implement the training solution, post TNA, it is possible that they may be involved in subsequent working groups, to provide training support advice. 9. Exploiting existing training activities. The need to design training from scratch on a  blank sheet of paper  is a very unusual occurrence, as it is much more likely that existing training can be modified. It follows, therefore that it is often desirable to analyse the current training first. Where current role information, Role PS / Framework(s) or TOs do not exist for any current training, more comprehensive RA may be required, before any determination of a training requirement can be made. Analysis of similar, existing, training is also useful to support this. 10. Audit trail. A TNA should generate a clear audit trail which plots the sequence of events and decisions leading to a training solution. The justification and supporting evidence used as the basis for these decisions should be readily apparent (such as: references to, and/or copies of, academic research literature; the deliberations of the Analysts; minutes of TNASG meetings and Defence/Contractor publications). A quality audit trail requires full disclosure of, and rationale for, the methodology, tools and data sources used in the analysis, with copies of any specialist or bespoke software made available to the TNASG."

    "content": "11. Iterative/selective nature of TNAs. Whilst a TNA is carried out by completing a number of activities in sequence, it is important to note that the process is iterative in nature. Many influencing factors, risks and assumptions are liable to change during the conduct of a TNA. It is therefore important that at every stage of a TNA, the key outputs are reviewed to ensure their continuing validity, and that stages of the process be repeated if necessary. Processes for reviewing the TNA outputs should be capable of amendment where changes are required. Tight control should be exercised by the TNASG, which approves all changes to the TNA. Follow-on changes to the training requirement and the impact on training may be managed through a system of configuration control but this does not remove the responsibility of the TNASG for ensuring that changes are reflected in the TNA. 12. It should be noted that the cheapest option is not necessarily the most cost-effective option in meeting the training requirement. Also, the cheapest option is not necessarily to continue existing training within existing resources. Therefore,  effectiveness  is the key as it is the extent to which the training has prepared the individual for the Defence effect which matters. Cost is  efficiency  focused to optimise the use of resources to enable the execution of training (and required learning) and ensure Value for Money (VfM)."

    "content": "1. The scoping exercise involves the initial analysis of the requirement and, where applicable, suggested options for meeting the requirement including a broad order estimate of the resource implications associated with each option. This is articulated in the Scoping Exercise Report. The scoping exercise should be completed as early as possible and starts by acquiring as much relevant information as possible about the training need and the Customer requirement. It defines the TNA management, risk, programming and resourcing within the boundaries of policy, assumptions and constraints. It also highlights issues that impact upon, or will need to be considered, during Stage 2. It will advise the TNA strategy for the proposed training solution and provide the parameters of the new or changed Defence requirement where TNAs will be, or have been, carried out. The scoping exercise does not have to be a long and protracted document and can utilise electronic references such as minutes of meetings, records of conversations to provide an auditable trail. 2. Provided that a training need is confirmed then a search of existing training activities across Defence, including the DLE, is to be conducted to ascertain if training, already designed, could satisfy, or partly satisfy, the need. The scoping exercise should then outline the aim, constraint, assumptions, proposed methodology and timescales, and provide an estimate of the resources required for the subsequent analysis and design stages. 3. The scoping exercise is the initial investigation and should derive a strategy and tentative solution for meeting the need for a training intervention. As this investigation progresses, decisions about how to apply the DSAT process should be made. For example, is it necessary to complete a full Role Analysis (RA) from first principles, or is it sufficient to confirm that an existing Role PS / Framework is still valid? Likewise, the strategy may recommend the process focuses on certain elements of a Role/task Performance which need further development or perhaps recommends targeting the TOs to ensure they support a Role PS and/or Framework. It may be decided that the sequence of training be reviewed if this is highlighted as a potential problem or that further consideration is given to current refresher training intervals. The scoping exercise should also cover a list of the resources required to complete the subsequent activities and an agreement as to which organisation(s) will provide them."

It should include an estimate of the population to be trained in terms of their personal characteristics, the annual throughput and the input standard6. This information can then be used to inform and refine the SOTR (5.5). 7. Identification of personal characteristics. In the course of analysing a particular role, it is often the case that to carry out the role effectively, an individual should possess certain characteristics. If this is so, then it is important to determine an appropriate balance between selection and training in order to provide people who have these characteristics and who are, therefore, capable of doing the role. The training audience is the group of learners for whom the training requirement is intended. The purpose of this description is to identify the: a. training audience groupings, the number and type of groups that need to be addressed (e.g. operator, maintainer, manager, train-the-trainer; individual, team, unit etc)."

The TNA process should initially focus on satisfying the strategic need with the caveat that proposed training solutions are compared with the initial constraints as part of the TOA and/or EA. Further constraints are the timing/development of the TNA, accessibility to SMEs and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). The TNA may be directed to examine a particular potential training solution, however, without prejudicing the final outcome. Constraints may also be identified in strategic trends, doctrine, concept documents (e.g. the Concept of Employment for a capability) or can be determined through contextual analysis (such as via PESTLE7 or other frameworks). They should also involve consideration of all the Defence Lines of Development (DLoDs)8. Key constraints include: a. Policy. On occasion, Defence Policy will dictate the Methods and Media to be used. The TNA should adhere to the DTEL Rules9 and Defence Policy for Modelling & Simulation (M&S) (JSP 939), as well as taking account of policies on the use of the Support Solutions Envelope, Integrated Logistic Support 10 and Human Factors Integration for Defence Systems (JSP 912). SCs may also mandate the use of specific training environments or solutions, which should be documented. b. Cost.

From this analysis, a constraints table, risk register and an assumptions register (including a Master Data Assumptions List as required) should be compiled and maintained by the analyst and reviewed by the TNASG, noting that a constraints analysis is an iterative process and may determine that a training intervention is not the most appropriate way to address the Defence need."

    "content": "2. There is a danger of concentrating wholly on the Role and so there is a requirement to widen the perspective to consider it in context. A Role does not exist in isolation but within the context of a particular organisation and situation. This context may affect not only the way the RA is conducted but also the eventual design of the training solution. As part of the identification process, users may wish to produce a Role Specification 18 and/or Role Description within the context of the individual Role, taking into consideration the factors listed below. Any identification process should consider: a. higher level context, including strategic context operational doctrine and team/collective scenarios. b. external context, including wider environment and conditions, for both individual and team/collective, and number of personnel fulfilling the Role."

Two examples of Initial KSA Analysis relating to a Role are at Annex A. 14. Knowledge. Knowledge is information acquired through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. Knowledge generally involves recalling information, e.g. the knowledge of rules and regulations, names, sequences, classifications, methodology, events, principles or theories.

KSA Analysis identifies the supporting knowledge required for task performance. Training should only contain knowledge which is essential to the satisfactory performance of a task.

    "content": "16. Skills. A skill is defined as an organised and co-ordinated pattern of mental and/or physical activity. It is the ability to do something well. It is built up gradually by repeated correct training or practice. At Initial KSA analysis, the skills listed are kept quite high level. Later on in the Design process the split into mental and physical/practical skills can be further refined: a. Mental skills. These constitute the knowing how (procedural knowledge) as opposed to the knowing what (facts) (e.g. knowing how to calculate percentages, knowing how to interpret technical data, knowing how to classify sonar contacts). It would not be possible for the trainee to learn all of these things as facts because too many individual instances exist. The mental skills the trainee learns, therefore, enable them to respond to entire classes of situations, e.g. to make decisions when presented with information and alternative courses of action. b. Physical/practical skills. These can be described as learned capabilities of performing actions in an organised and fluid manner. They are overt and observable during their performance. Skills may be discrete (operate a switch) or continuous (fly/drive a vehicle). These skills are learned in connection with common activities such as using a computer, driving a car or playing a musical instrument. Many tasks performed in Defence can be categorised as having a large physical component, e.g. stripping and assembling a weapon (discrete), flying an aircraft (continuous) and tying a bowline (discrete). Complex physical skills can often be broken down into smaller sub-skills, which can be learned separately and then put together for total performance. An example of this is swimming, which has 3 sub-skills (arm action, leg action and breathing technique), which can be learned and practised separately and then performed as one. More complex skills such as flying/driving, are similarly broken down into their component parts and taught as discrete skills in discrete lessons."

    "content": "17. Attitudes. An Attitude is a way of thinking and feeling about something, often but not always demonstrated through behaviour. The identification of Standards relating to personal qualities and Attitudes is perhaps the most challenging part of the KSA Analysis. This is because Attitudes cannot always be observed directly and hence the creation of definable standards can prove difficult. Attitude is defined as a predisposition resulting in a tendency to act or react in a certain manner when confronted with another person, group, object, situation or idea. It is important to understand that this predisposition to think and feel in a certain way does not necessarily result in observable behaviours. An example of this could be an individual who holds an Attitude that all dogs are dangerous. However, this attitude may not be obvious to others when the individual is handling a dog with which they are familiar and have learned is friendly. Table 2 illustrates how Attitudes can manifest themselves. Attitudes generally: * are learned from experience (or from others);"

    "content": "18. Within each role there are tasks that have an attitudinal component related to their performance. Initial KSA Analysis identifies Attitudes associated with role performance to determine the required direction of that attitude. At this stage the Analysis of Attitude can be quite high level. The depth of the analysis within the attitudinal domain will occur at course design stage/A Spec stage. Once the Attitudes required to fulfil a Role are identified, training can be designed to achieve them. Knowledge and skill training can be wasted if attitudinal training is ignored. A lecture on computer security may be successful in imparting information on how viruses are transmitted but unless it develops an attitude of security consciousness the trainees may not use the knowledge they have gained on the subject. 19. To assess an attitude, behaviour must be observed, possibly over a period of time. To assist subjective judgements on attitude an objective criteria should, where possible, be used to support the decision. Defining the negative, what is unacceptable behaviour, can result in a simpler and more precise Standard. A Behaviourally Anchored Rating Scale (BARS) is an example of a tool which can be used to assess observable behaviour objectively. Although a BARS (Table 3) can be used to measure attitude indirectly through observing behaviour, much care is needed when inferring Attitudes from observable behaviours alone. Attitudes may also be directly measured using validated questionnaires or other psychometric instruments21. Some examples are presented in Table 3. Note that whilst BARS is predominantly a tool used in the training environment, forming part of the ASpec if appropriate, it is mentioned here because it is useful to bear it in mind at the RA stage."

In order to develop an optimised training system it is important to consider both how Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes are acquired and how they are retained over time. Understanding the rate at which different types of Knowledge and Skills fade can inform training design and the setting of refresher training intervals. In order to conduct refresher training interval analysis, it can be useful to use a more detailed breakdown of Knowledge and Skills than that discussed in DSAT activity   Initial Knowledge, Skills, Attitudes (KSA) Analysis.

Trainers should do the following: i) Present trainees with a series of practice examples illustrating the range of different conditions that they may subsequently encounter in the field including any unusual situations; and ii) Encourage trainees to think about these situations, make errors and learn from them. Guided training can be blended with active learning for complex tasks by directing trainees in how to explore training resources and make errors so that it is clear that they are an expected aspect of training.

Competence development (in the form of a Role PS and associated training solutions) is covered under the DSAT training analysis process contained within this policy.

Where an external awarding body has already developed an appropriate competence framework (usually in the form of job-related standards/qualifications grouped under competence areas) it is acceptable within the DSAT process to utilise this, as appropriate, rather than developing bespoke a Role PS from scratch. This has the added benefit of easing the accreditation process and aiding skills transfer from both within Defence and externally (particularly during transition to civilian life). Furthermore, where similar competences are employed over a wide range of roles across Defence (e.g. more than one TLB), it may be appropriate to develop a competence framework for particular professions/trades in Defence. The use of an established competence framework does not absolve the analyst from capturing both the requirement and solution within the TrAD along with the necessary documentation; ensuring it is endorsed by the CEB. In particular, where a competence framework is used, CEBs should assure themselves that the solution does not greatly exceed the requirements of the role just in order to meet desirable external accreditation or to save resource expenditure on the analysis phase, which may be detrimental to the final training solution."

TOs form the basis of the detailed design of each of the training lessons as well as identification of appropriate training resources. They may also be used in support of the award of civilian accreditation. Therefore, the development and maintenance of accurate TOs is essential. TOs are drafted during Element 1 and then these draft TOs should be further refined and developed during Element 2 (Design). 2. TOs are precise statements of what tasks a trainee should be able to do, post training, in the Role that the training was designed to prepare them for. A TO is measurable and has three constituents: the Performance required, the Conditions under which the trainee must perform, and the Standard to which the trainee must perform. These statements should be in the form of observable and measurable behaviours which allow the achievement of the TOs to be confirmed through assessment. A TO defines what a successful trainee is able to do at the end of a period of training, i.e. the learning outcome25. It does not describe the learning process or any learning experience. 3. TOs should be derived from the respective Role PS / Framework(s). The determination of TOs is a skilled process and the product must accurately reflect the needs of the Role.

The Conditions element of a TO, specifies the actual Conditions, or circumstances, in which the training Performance will take place. In training, the ideal solution is to provide the same Conditions normally experienced in the Role, e.g. using the real equipment. As this is not always possible, the Conditions element must clearly indicate what the training environment can provide. The Conditions element should fully describe the environment in which the trainee should carry out the task. Conditions can be considered in these broad categories:"

Standards in TOs should not be confused with the standards of tests. Whilst test standards should be set as closely as possible to those stated against the TO, there are certain areas where compromise may be necessary when setting test standards. 11. The identification of Standards relating to personal qualities, attitudes and behaviours is perhaps the most challenging part of TO development. This is because attitudes cannot be observed directly and hence the precision associated with other Standards is rarely possible. For subjective judgements objective criteria should, where possible, be used to support the decision (e.g. what observable behaviour is the key indicator that a trainee has acquired the appropriate Standard?). Defining the negative, what is unacceptable behaviour, can result in a simpler and more precise Standard. 12. TO Tagging and Numbering. TOs should be tagged to identify them as a Core (training) requirement, Legal requirement and/or Accreditation requirement, which is denoted using a letter (C, L, A) or a mark in the relevant column on the training statements with amplifying comments if appropriate. To ensure that training is allocated to all tasks, the link between tasks and TOs should be shown through an auditable numbering/identification system. This can be achieved by using the task numbers from the Role PS to identify their dependent TOs. An example is at Table 10."

Fidelity can be defined as,  the exact correspondence with fact or with a given quality, condition, or event; accuracy (e.g. the fidelity of the movie to the book or the degree to which an electronic system accurately reproduces the sound or image of its input signal ). This analysis should be conducted as a result of the production of a Role PS derived from the RA and include any existing Training Performance Standards. Fidelity Analysis considers each relevant Performance objective in the Role PS to assess the extent to which the training environment should replicate the workplace (real) environment to enable training to be effective. Decisions made at this stage can have a significant impact on the nature and cost of training solutions, as fidelity can be a significant cost driver, so it is important not to  gold plate  the fidelity requirements, but instead determine the appropriate level of fidelity that is essential to achieve the desired training effect. The results of Fidelity Analysis will help inform the Conditions under which training should be conducted to adequately prepare trainees for their future Roles. 3. Categories.

For example, constraints on training resources and the availability of real equipment for training may force the emphasis towards workplace training. The same would be true if it is not possible to replicate critical Role PS Conditions in training establishments or via distributed training. Alternatively expensive and scarce training equipment or qualified trainers may only be available in [some] training establishments. It is therefore important to determine an estimate of where the balance between training to be delivered in a training establishment and workplace training will fall. It is based on a careful analysis of exactly what the TRA requires, tempered by that which is deliverable and can only be achieved by consultation with the TRA and the Training Provider, who will have knowledge of existing training and current training facilities and resources. This will later result in the allocation of TOs to a TPS, WTS, or, where no training will take place, the Performance, Conditions and Standards to a RTGS32. The output from this work could be an amendment to the Initial Training Categories or recommendations that take account of both DIF Analysis results and the impact of all other Role, training and resource factors."

The Method used to deliver training depends on whether learning is categorised as Knowledge, a mental or physical Skill, or an Attitude. Each EO must be examined to determine whether it is primarily expressed as a KSA. This will suggest the appropriate choice of Method (e.g. a Skills-based EO must have some element of practice involved in the Method; whilst role-play is an example of a training Method suitable for a Behaviour-based EO). The aim must be to choose a Method that is compatible with the material to be learned. Learning a physical Skill may require equipment and machinery and a low trainee-to-trainer ratio as it tends to be trainee-centric. Knowledge learning is most effective and efficient via e-learning, in the form of a lecture, or with links to information. This works best in a flipped classroom, where learning is then consolidated through discussion."

The appropriate selection of training Methods improves the effectiveness and efficiency of learning. Wherever possible, a learner-focused approach should be adopted although this is not always as simple as it seems as it can be time consuming and resource heavy. A learner-focused approach aids information retention by considering the needs of the trainees and increasing their involvement in the learning process. A trainer-focused approach, whilst increasing trainee-to-trainer ratios, is not as effective for aiding trainee retention. The more active the trainee is in the learning process, the higher the rate of retention. 11. Learning preferences. Learning takes place when learners reflect on what they have done, or from what others have done. Therefore, it is imperative that for the effective and efficient acquisition of the required KSA, time is built into the programme, to facilitate learning through reflection. People learn from reflecting on their own, or others experience. Therefore, enabling experiential learning is the most effective and efficient way of enabling learning. Trainee characteristics."

Trainers are unlikely to use Media that they do not understand, which increases their workload, or which is complex to manage. If new teaching Methods are to be introduced, then due regard must be given to ensuring that trainers are both willing and able to cope. To avoid such issues designers should: a. involve trainers in the Design process as early as possible. b. identify any additional trainer training requirements."

If training specialists become involved with costing or investment appraisal, they should obtain current advice from the TNASG or other authoritative body. CBA activity does not start at this stage of the TNA but the result of it is included in the Training Needs Report hence its inclusion here. Like many aspects of DSAT, CBA is an iterative process with initial activity commencing much earlier in the TNA process, as appropriate. The CBA will likely be further refined during the Method & Media selection process in Element 2 (Design). An estimate of the financial risks and/or opportunities associated with each training solution option should be undertaken.
