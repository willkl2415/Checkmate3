    "content": "1. A TNA is a structured analysis of training need arising as a result of new equipment acquisition, doctrinal change, organisational change, or changes to policy/legislation. It generally includes an analysis of different training Methods and technologies, with a view to recommending the optimum training solution which balances cost and quality. It is a highly flexible procedure with the choice of supporting tools and techniques to suit different Training Systems. In all cases, however, a TNA is an output based, iterative process that provides an audit trail for all decisions and is closely mapped to the requirements of the QMS. A TNA does not, and should not, imply that training will be the only solution. If training is not the solution, this will become apparent in the Scoping Exercise, after which, analysis activity will cease. 1. The TNA provides an audit trail of analysis to determine the need for training and, if required, enable design of a training solution. The process described below is a 3-stage process with a number of specified outputs. However, it should be emphasised that this recommended approach is not necessarily linear nor does it have to be followed prescriptively. In many cases there may not be a requirement to produce all of the suggested output products, and there may be merit in conducting stages or activities concurrently."

The TOA considers each relevant Task in the Role PS / Competence Framework to assess the extent to which the training environment should replicate the workplace (real) environment to enable training to be effective. This is known as the Fidelity Analysis. The implications of locations and environment for training and Methods & Media options are then considered. The key outputs are the realistic options for Methods & Media and refinement (based upon fidelity, locations and environment) of the possible training solutions. Cost-effective options which take account of Whole Life training requirements (including refresher training) are considered. (5) Training Needs Report (TNR). The Training Needs Report analyses the cost benefits and then evaluates the merits of the training options, before confirming the TNASG endorsed training solution. The report includes the Role PS and/or Framework(s). The key output is a recommendation as to the most cost-effective training solution, which inputs into the SOTR. An implementation plan is also included."

Before a TNA can begin, a clear evidence-based Statement of Requirement (SoR) is to be produced, preferably in a written format (letter, e-mail, request form or tasking order, for example). Then, prior to the commencement of the analysis, a scoping exercise is conducted which may identify that the most cost-effective means of achieving the required Defence need, is a training solution2. Once the requirement for training has been established, a TNA should be undertaken to ascertain the type and scope of the training requirement that meets the Defence need. It should be noted that a TNA may range from a simple interview to a process lasting several months. See DTSM 1 for more information on a SoR. 4. Responsibility. It is expected that the Training Requirements Authority (TRA) will take the lead on the production of the DSAT activities, processes and outputs required to be completed during Element 1. The TRA may wish to delegate specific tasks, but will retain overall responsibility for them. The TRA will also be expected to ensure that those activities deemed critical to the development of the Training System are conducted. A key activity is the establishment of a TNA Steering Group (TNASG), upon receipt of a SOR, or other authority, to begin the TNA process. The TRA is ultimately responsible to the Customer for the work conducted during this Element. See DTSM 1 for more information on a TRA."

    "content": "7. As a general rule, a TNA should be used when a change in Defence capability is likely to have a significant impact on the training resources required to generate trained output. The TNA should be fit for purpose, provide an auditable trail and determine the most cost- effective training solution. The TNA may vary in complexity from a simple scoping exercise to an extensive process requiring a dedicated team of Needs Analysts. 8. Non-training specialist involvement in a TNA. Stakeholders often have a limited knowledge of the MTS and are unfamiliar with the TNA process. At the start of a TNA, time is often well spent in educating those who are to be involved in the TNA about the process. They should be aware of their responsibilities, including the provision of information and staffing routines. Whilst it is not usually the TNA author s responsibility to the implement the training solution, post TNA, it is possible that they may be involved in subsequent working groups, to provide training support advice. 9. Exploiting existing training activities. The need to design training from scratch on a  blank sheet of paper  is a very unusual occurrence, as it is much more likely that existing training can be modified. It follows, therefore that it is often desirable to analyse the current training first. Where current role information, Role PS / Framework(s) or TOs do not exist for any current training, more comprehensive RA may be required, before any determination of a training requirement can be made. Analysis of similar, existing, training is also useful to support this."

    "content": "10. Audit trail. A TNA should generate a clear audit trail which plots the sequence of events and decisions leading to a training solution. The justification and supporting evidence used as the basis for these decisions should be readily apparent (such as: references to, and/or copies of, academic research literature; the deliberations of the Analysts; minutes of TNASG meetings and Defence/Contractor publications). A quality audit trail requires full disclosure of, and rationale for, the methodology, tools and data sources used in the analysis, with copies of any specialist or bespoke software made available to the TNASG. 11. Iterative/selective nature of TNAs. Whilst a TNA is carried out by completing a number of activities in sequence, it is important to note that the process is iterative in nature. Many influencing factors, risks and assumptions are liable to change during the conduct of a TNA. It is therefore important that at every stage of a TNA, the key outputs are reviewed to ensure their continuing validity, and that stages of the process be repeated if necessary. Processes for reviewing the TNA outputs should be capable of amendment where changes are required. Tight control should be exercised by the TNASG, which approves all changes to the TNA. Follow-on changes to the training requirement and the impact on training may be managed through a system of configuration control but this does not remove the responsibility of the TNASG for ensuring that changes are reflected in the TNA. 12. It should be noted that the cheapest option is not necessarily the most cost-effective option in meeting the training requirement. Also, the cheapest option is not necessarily to continue existing training within existing resources. Therefore,  effectiveness  is the key as it is the extent to which the training has prepared the individual for the Defence effect which matters. Cost is  efficiency  focused to optimise the use of resources to enable the execution of training (and required learning) and ensure Value for Money (VfM)."

    "content": "1. The scoping exercise involves the initial analysis of the requirement and, where applicable, suggested options for meeting the requirement including a broad order estimate of the resource implications associated with each option. This is articulated in the Scoping Exercise Report. The scoping exercise should be completed as early as possible and starts by acquiring as much relevant information as possible about the training need and the Customer requirement. It defines the TNA management, risk, programming and resourcing within the boundaries of policy, assumptions and constraints. It also highlights issues that impact upon, or will need to be considered, during Stage 2. It will advise the TNA strategy for the proposed training solution and provide the parameters of the new or changed Defence requirement where TNAs will be, or have been, carried out. The scoping exercise does not have to be a long and protracted document and can utilise electronic references such as minutes of meetings, records of conversations to provide an auditable trail. 2. Provided that a training need is confirmed then a search of existing training activities across Defence, including the DLE, is to be conducted to ascertain if training, already designed, could satisfy, or partly satisfy, the need. The scoping exercise should then outline the aim, constraint, assumptions, proposed methodology and timescales, and provide an estimate of the resources required for the subsequent analysis and design stages. 3. The scoping exercise is the initial investigation and should derive a strategy and tentative solution for meeting the need for a training intervention. As this investigation progresses, decisions about how to apply the DSAT process should be made. For example, is it necessary to complete a full Role Analysis (RA) from first principles, or is it sufficient to confirm that an existing Role PS / Framework is still valid? Likewise, the strategy may recommend the process focuses on certain elements of a Role/task Performance which need further development or perhaps recommends targeting the TOs to ensure they support a Role PS and/or Framework. It may be decided that the sequence of training be reviewed if this is highlighted as a potential problem or that further consideration is given to current refresher training intervals. The scoping exercise should also cover a list of the resources required to complete the subsequent activities and an agreement as to which organisation(s) will provide them."

This information can then be used to inform and refine the SOTR (5.5). 7. Identification of personal characteristics. In the course of analysing a particular role, it is often the case that to carry out the role effectively, an individual should possess certain characteristics. If this is so, then it is important to determine an appropriate balance between selection and training in order to provide people who have these characteristics and who are, therefore, capable of doing the role. The training audience is the group of learners for whom the training requirement is intended. The purpose of this description is to identify the: a. training audience groupings, the number and type of groups that need to be addressed (e.g. operator, maintainer, manager, train-the-trainer; individual, team, unit etc)."

Training throughput. An estimate of training throughput numbers (total audience and annual throughput requirements) will inform requirements for the size and capacity of the potential training solution and must be made available to inform the SOTR process. The SOTR forecasts annual throughput requirements 4 years in advance, in order to help generate the required capability. Throughput numbers may be required in support of a variety of related training solutions for each distinct training audience group. Throughput figures should be calculated separately for each type of training required and for all affected Defence people, MoD civilians and Contractors. Training throughput figures should be presented in table or graph format, along with any throughput assumptions.

The TNA process should initially focus on satisfying the strategic need with the caveat that proposed training solutions are compared with the initial constraints as part of the TOA and/or EA. Further constraints are the timing/development of the TNA, accessibility to SMEs and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). The TNA may be directed to examine a particular potential training solution, however, without prejudicing the final outcome. Constraints may also be identified in strategic trends, doctrine, concept documents (e.g. the Concept of Employment for a capability) or can be determined through contextual analysis (such as via PESTLE7 or other frameworks). They should also involve consideration of all the Defence Lines of Development (DLoDs)8. Key constraints include: a. Policy. On occasion, Defence Policy will dictate the Methods and Media to be used. The TNA should adhere to the DTEL Rules9 and Defence Policy for Modelling & Simulation (M&S) (JSP 939), as well as taking account of policies on the use of the Support Solutions Envelope, Integrated Logistic Support 10 and Human Factors Integration for Defence Systems (JSP 912).

Information sources include previous TNAs, Human Factors (HF) studies and evaluation reports on similar requirement(s). For major projects, where more than one TNA is being undertaken, it can be useful to indicate the relationship between the various TNAs. d. Potential training services. The major types of training Methods & Media likely to be considered or examined should be included at this stage and then re-examined later. This will reflect the current training policy and should specify any areas requiring particular attention, such as the possible need for synthetic training, embedded training or Public/Private Partnership or Private Finance Initiative (PPP/PFI) solutions. These are only possible options and may change during the TOA/EA as a result of developments in policy, technology etc. An estimate of the cost of these services should be provided. Any new training solutions may have to utilise existing training facilities and associated established support elements (ie course design) which should be recorded in the report. e. Methodology. The TNA methodology should be tailored to suit the specific training requirement but should always provide a full audit trail. For example, in the case of a small change to training policy, a TGA followed by a TOA to establish the most cost-effective Methods & Media would be sufficient. Equally, if the training is to fit into an existing training activity using similar delivery techniques and Media, then a full blown TNA may be unnecessary. The outputs from the scoping exercise and subsequent analyses should be agreed during Stage 1 of the TNA, which will allow the user to select the correct methodology and tools based on the constraints and information available at the time. Analysis should not be conducted as a  check list exercise , but should only be undertaken if it adds value to the TNA. TNA is an iterative process and the TNA outputs are therefore subject to continuous review."

    "content": "17 A  job  can be made up of many Roles. Therefore, it can be argued that jobs (in the traditional sense of a person conducting a single task requiring a single skill, for example) seldom exist. Accordingly, it is more appropriate to analyse a Role that a person will fulfil. An example would be a RN Catering Services rating, who is trained in the primary Role but routinely has other Roles and duties aboard ship that are not related to the primary role (such as firefighting and First Aid). Training that person for the job of Catering Services/Fire Fighter/First Aider is impractical, but training that person for the primary Role , then the Role of fire fighter and the First Aider makes more sense. Thus RA is a more logical term than Job Analysis and more reflective of what this analysis actually does."

Task frequency becomes significant, however, when considering retraining, since frequently performed tasks do not require retraining if performance is adequate.

DIF analysis is a useful technique which contributes to providing a rational basis for making decisions on the design of training which is superior to guesswork or intuition. However, other criteria may be used to decide upon levels of training; including numbers of service personnel performing the task, ease of training within the unit, how soon after training someone is expected to perform the task and how much time is spent performing the task."

It is important to note that a Role PS can refer directly to a requirement for knowledge when it is linked to the practical performance in a Role as stated in the Role PS. KSA Analysis identifies the supporting knowledge required for task performance. Training should only contain knowledge which is essential to the satisfactory performance of a task. For example, where key references are available at the time a task is performed, there may only be a requirement to learn how to access the information rather than learn the contents. Wider knowledge acquisition and application is the remit of education."

    "content": "16. Skills. A skill is defined as an organised and co-ordinated pattern of mental and/or physical activity. It is the ability to do something well. It is built up gradually by repeated correct training or practice. At Initial KSA analysis, the skills listed are kept quite high level. Later on in the Design process the split into mental and physical/practical skills can be further refined: a. Mental skills. These constitute the knowing how (procedural knowledge) as opposed to the knowing what (facts) (e.g. knowing how to calculate percentages, knowing how to interpret technical data, knowing how to classify sonar contacts). It would not be possible for the trainee to learn all of these things as facts because too many individual instances exist. The mental skills the trainee learns, therefore, enable them to respond to entire classes of situations, e.g. to make decisions when presented with information and alternative courses of action. b. Physical/practical skills. These can be described as learned capabilities of performing actions in an organised and fluid manner. They are overt and observable during their performance. Skills may be discrete (operate a switch) or continuous (fly/drive a vehicle). These skills are learned in connection with common activities such as using a computer, driving a car or playing a musical instrument. Many tasks performed in Defence can be categorised as having a large physical component, e.g. stripping and assembling a weapon (discrete), flying an aircraft (continuous) and tying a bowline (discrete). Complex physical skills can often be broken down into smaller sub-skills, which can be learned separately and then put together for total performance. An example of this is swimming, which has 3 sub-skills (arm action, leg action and breathing technique), which can be learned and practised separately and then performed as one. More complex skills such as flying/driving, are similarly broken down into their component parts and taught as discrete skills in discrete lessons."

    "content": "17. Attitudes. An Attitude is a way of thinking and feeling about something, often but not always demonstrated through behaviour. The identification of Standards relating to personal qualities and Attitudes is perhaps the most challenging part of the KSA Analysis. This is because Attitudes cannot always be observed directly and hence the creation of definable standards can prove difficult. Attitude is defined as a predisposition resulting in a tendency to act or react in a certain manner when confronted with another person, group, object, situation or idea. It is important to understand that this predisposition to think and feel in a certain way does not necessarily result in observable behaviours. An example of this could be an individual who holds an Attitude that all dogs are dangerous. However, this attitude may not be obvious to others when the individual is handling a dog with which they are familiar and have learned is friendly. Table 2 illustrates how Attitudes can manifest themselves. Attitudes generally: * are learned from experience (or from others);"

    "content": "18. Within each role there are tasks that have an attitudinal component related to their performance. Initial KSA Analysis identifies Attitudes associated with role performance to determine the required direction of that attitude. At this stage the Analysis of Attitude can be quite high level. The depth of the analysis within the attitudinal domain will occur at course design stage/A Spec stage. Once the Attitudes required to fulfil a Role are identified, training can be designed to achieve them. Knowledge and skill training can be wasted if attitudinal training is ignored. A lecture on computer security may be successful in imparting information on how viruses are transmitted but unless it develops an attitude of security consciousness the trainees may not use the knowledge they have gained on the subject. 19. To assess an attitude, behaviour must be observed, possibly over a period of time. To assist subjective judgements on attitude an objective criteria should, where possible, be used to support the decision. Defining the negative, what is unacceptable behaviour, can result in a simpler and more precise Standard. A Behaviourally Anchored Rating Scale (BARS) is an example of a tool which can be used to assess observable behaviour objectively. Although a BARS (Table 3) can be used to measure attitude indirectly through observing behaviour, much care is needed when inferring Attitudes from observable behaviours alone. Attitudes may also be directly measured using validated questionnaires or other psychometric instruments21. Some examples are presented in Table 3. Note that whilst BARS is predominantly a tool used in the training environment, forming part of the ASpec if appropriate, it is mentioned here because it is useful to bear it in mind at the RA stage."

Acquisition can take less total time and the retention can be 50% better. The optimal inter study interval in distributed training protocols lies between 10-30% of the retention interval with longer inter-study intervals enhancing retention more than shorter inter-study interval.  A longer-than-optimal spacing is better than shorter- than-optimal spacing."

The instructor creates a training environment in which the trainee can: i) learn to organise new information into existing mental frameworks which hold prior knowledge in order to generate new knowledge about the context; and ii) practise the application of newly acquired knowledge and skills. Knowledge, skills and behaviours attained at a higher (cognitive) level are retained for longer. An example is error management training where trainees are given the opportunity to make errors and learn from them. Trainers should do the following: i) Present trainees with a series of practice examples illustrating the range of different conditions that they may subsequently encounter in the field including any unusual situations; and ii) Encourage trainees to think about these situations, make errors and learn from them."

Where an external awarding body has already developed an appropriate competence framework (usually in the form of job-related standards/qualifications grouped under competence areas) it is acceptable within the DSAT process to utilise this, as appropriate, rather than developing bespoke a Role PS from scratch. This has the added benefit of easing the accreditation process and aiding skills transfer from both within Defence and externally (particularly during transition to civilian life). Furthermore, where similar competences are employed over a wide range of roles across Defence (e.g. more than one TLB), it may be appropriate to develop a competence framework for particular professions/trades in Defence. The use of an established competence framework does not absolve the analyst from capturing both the requirement and solution within the TrAD along with the necessary documentation; ensuring it is endorsed by the CEB. In particular, where a competence framework is used, CEBs should assure themselves that the solution does not greatly exceed the requirements of the role just in order to meet desirable external accreditation or to save resource expenditure on the analysis phase, which may be detrimental to the final training solution."

Defining the negative, what is unacceptable behaviour, can result in a simpler and more precise Standard. 12. TO Tagging and Numbering. TOs should be tagged to identify them as a Core (training) requirement, Legal requirement and/or Accreditation requirement, which is denoted using a letter (C, L, A) or a mark in the relevant column on the training statements with amplifying comments if appropriate.

Fidelity can be defined as,  the exact correspondence with fact or with a given quality, condition, or event; accuracy (e.g. the fidelity of the movie to the book or the degree to which an electronic system accurately reproduces the sound or image of its input signal ). This analysis should be conducted as a result of the production of a Role PS derived from the RA and include any existing Training Performance Standards. Fidelity Analysis considers each relevant Performance objective in the Role PS to assess the extent to which the training environment should replicate the workplace (real) environment to enable training to be effective. Decisions made at this stage can have a significant impact on the nature and cost of training solutions, as fidelity can be a significant cost driver, so it is important not to  gold plate  the fidelity requirements, but instead determine the appropriate level of fidelity that is essential to achieve the desired training effect. The results of Fidelity Analysis will help inform the Conditions under which training should be conducted to adequately prepare trainees for their future Roles. 3. Categories. Fidelity can be divided into four categories and sub-categories, combinations of which may apply to each Role PS task / Competence / Competency being analysed. 29 Not all organisations carry out Fidelity Analysis at this stage.

Alternatively expensive and scarce training equipment or qualified trainers may only be available in [some] training establishments. It is therefore important to determine an estimate of where the balance between training to be delivered in a training establishment and workplace training will fall. It is based on a careful analysis of exactly what the TRA requires, tempered by that which is deliverable and can only be achieved by consultation with the TRA and the Training Provider, who will have knowledge of existing training and current training facilities and resources. This will later result in the allocation of TOs to a TPS, WTS, or, where no training will take place, the Performance, Conditions and Standards to a RTGS32.

    "content": "9. Type of learning. The Method used to deliver training depends on whether learning is categorised as Knowledge, a mental or physical Skill, or an Attitude. Each EO must be examined to determine whether it is primarily expressed as a KSA. This will suggest the appropriate choice of Method (e.g. a Skills-based EO must have some element of practice involved in the Method; whilst role-play is an example of a training Method suitable for a Behaviour-based EO). The aim must be to choose a Method that is compatible with the material to be learned. Learning a physical Skill may require equipment and machinery and a low trainee-to-trainer ratio as it tends to be trainee-centric. Knowledge learning is most effective and efficient via e-learning, in the form of a lecture, or with links to information. This works best in a flipped classroom, where learning is then consolidated through discussion. 10. Retention ability. A basic categorisation of training Methods should state that these can either be trainer or learner centric. The appropriate selection of training Methods improves the effectiveness and efficiency of learning. Wherever possible, a learner-focused approach should be adopted although this is not always as simple as it seems as it can be time consuming and resource heavy. A learner-focused approach aids information retention by considering the needs of the trainees and increasing their involvement in the learning process. A trainer-focused approach, whilst increasing trainee-to-trainer ratios, is not as effective for aiding trainee retention. The more active the trainee is in the learning process, the higher the rate of retention. 11. Learning preferences. Learning takes place when learners reflect on what they have done, or from what others have done. Therefore, it is imperative that for the effective and efficient acquisition of the required KSA, time is built into the programme, to facilitate learning through reflection. People learn from reflecting on their own, or others experience. Therefore, enabling experiential learning is the most effective and efficient way of enabling learning."

Some Skills may be used on a daily basis while others may be only used sporadically but, when they are used, are essential. This requires Performance to be maintained at a consistently high Standard. The results of the DIF Analysis (1.3.3), the consideration of skill fade factors and/or the analysis of Critical Errors (1.3.3B) may have a significant influence on the Method selection. In subjects where the possibility of skill fade could have dire consequences, consideration must be given to ensuring that appropriate Methods & Media are implemented to enhance retention. This may or may not require the allocation of extra training time. THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS OF MEDIA"

In accordance with Defence and HM Treasury guidelines, an examination of the broad order costs of various options to recommend the most cost-effective training solution must be undertaken. It is important that costing and investment appraisal are undertaken strictly in accordance with the current Defence and Service or Strategic Command policies and conventions. If training specialists become involved with costing or investment appraisal, they should obtain current advice from the TNASG or other authoritative body. CBA activity does not start at this stage of the TNA but the result of it is included in the Training Needs Report hence its inclusion here. Like many aspects of DSAT, CBA is an iterative process with initial activity commencing much earlier in the TNA process, as appropriate. The CBA will likely be further refined during the Method & Media selection process in Element 2 (Design). An estimate of the financial risks and/or opportunities associated with each training solution option should be undertaken. Training staffs are unlikely to be qualified to conduct financial risk analysis at anything other than a superficial level33. However, these analyses will be a significant factor in selecting training solution options. 33 Trainers should therefore seek specialist advice and support from Defence, or, for industry, from specialists in the field."
