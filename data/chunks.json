    "content": "2.1 Training Needs Analysis\n\n\n1.\tThis Section of the Guidance outlines the Defence approach that allows training specialists to adopt a structured, methodical approach to the analysis of the training need, or requirement. It sets out the various activities, collectively termed the TNA, which may be used in order to conduct a TNA, which informs subsequent Elements and forms part of the overall Training System.\n2.1.1 Overview of the TNA\n\n1. A TNA is a structured analysis of training need arising as a result of new equipment acquisition, doctrinal change, organisational change, or changes to policy/legislation. It generally includes an analysis of different training Methods and technologies, with a view to recommending the optimum training solution which balances cost and quality. It is a highly flexible procedure with the choice of supporting tools and techniques to suit different Training Systems. In all cases, however, a TNA is an output based, iterative process that provides an audit trail for all decisions and is closely mapped to the requirements of the QMS. A TNA does not, and should not, imply that training will be the only solution."

The TNA provides an audit trail of analysis to determine the need for training and, if required, enable design of a training solution. The process described below is a 3-stage\n\nprocess with a number of specified outputs. However, it should be emphasised that this recommended approach is not necessarily linear nor does it have to be followed prescriptively. In many cases there may not be a requirement to produce all of the suggested output products, and there may be merit in conducting stages or activities concurrently.\n\n2. The principal activities of the TNA process, grouped together into the 3 Stages, are:\n\na. TNA, Stage 1.\n\n(1) Scoping Exercise Report. This identifies the management of the TNA, programming and resourcing issues, policies, constraints, risks and assumptions. The key output is the Scoping Exercise Report (which recommends possible training solutions). It also identifies if training is not the solution and no further analysis is required.\nb.

Before a TNA can begin, a clear evidence-based Statement of Requirement (SoR) is to be produced, preferably in a written format (letter, e-mail, request form or tasking order, for example). Then, prior to the commencement of the analysis, a scoping exercise is conducted which may identify that the most cost-effective means of achieving the required Defence need, is a training solution2. Once the requirement for training has been established, a TNA should be undertaken to ascertain the type and scope of the training requirement that meets the Defence need. It should be noted that a TNA may range from a simple interview to a process lasting several months. See DTSM 1 for more information on a SoR.\n4. Responsibility. It is expected that the Training Requirements Authority (TRA) will take the lead on the production of the DSAT activities, processes and outputs required to be completed during Element 1."

Training activities should meet Defence outputs; and, should these change, the training need should be re-analysed, via a TNA, and if necessary, adapted to support the new requirement(s). If a TNA is to be conducted, the user should consider:\n\na. the requirement being raised and the need to carry out a TNA.\nb. forming a TNA Steering Group (TNASG)3.\n\nc. assurance of the TNA process.\n\n6.

As a general rule, a TNA should be used when a change in Defence capability is likely to have a significant impact on the training resources required to generate trained output. The TNA should be fit for purpose, provide an auditable trail and determine the most cost- effective training solution. The TNA may vary in complexity from a simple scoping exercise to an extensive process requiring a dedicated team of Needs Analysts.\n\n8. Non-training specialist involvement in a TNA. Stakeholders often have a limited knowledge of the MTS and are unfamiliar with the TNA process. At the start of a TNA, time is often well spent in educating those who are to be involved in the TNA about the process. They should be aware of their responsibilities, including the provision of information and staffing routines."

Exploiting existing training activities. The need to design training from scratch on a  blank sheet of paper  is a very unusual occurrence, as it is much more likely that existing training can be modified. It follows, therefore that it is often desirable to analyse the current training first. Where current role information, Role PS / Framework(s) or TOs do not exist for any current training, more comprehensive RA may be required, before any determination of a training requirement can be made. Analysis of similar, existing, training is also useful to support this.\n10. Audit trail. A TNA should generate a clear audit trail which plots the sequence of events and decisions leading to a training solution."

Iterative/selective nature of TNAs. Whilst a TNA is carried out by completing a number of activities in sequence, it is important to note that the process is iterative in nature. Many influencing factors, risks and assumptions are liable to change during the conduct of a TNA. It is therefore important that at every stage of a TNA, the key outputs are reviewed to ensure their continuing validity, and that stages of the process be repeated if necessary. Processes for reviewing the TNA outputs should be capable of amendment where changes are required. Tight control should be exercised by the TNASG, which approves all changes to the TNA."

It should be noted that the cheapest option is not necessarily the most cost-effective option in meeting the training requirement. Also, the cheapest option is not necessarily to continue existing training within existing resources. Therefore,  effectiveness  is the key as it is the extent to which the training has prepared the individual for the Defence effect which matters. Cost is  efficiency  focused to optimise the use of resources to enable the execution of training (and required learning) and ensure Value for Money (VfM)."

The complexity and size of the training requirement will dictate the level of involvement of the TRA and whether responsibilities are delegated.

The scoping exercise is the initial investigation and should derive a strategy and tentative solution for meeting the need for a training intervention. As this investigation progresses, decisions about how to apply the DSAT process should be made. For example, is it necessary to complete a full Role Analysis (RA) from first principles, or is it sufficient to confirm that an existing Role PS / Framework is still valid? Likewise, the strategy may recommend the process focuses on certain elements of a Role/task Performance which need further development or perhaps recommends targeting the TOs to ensure they support a Role PS and/or Framework."

Therefore, it can be argued that jobs (in the traditional sense of a person conducting a single task requiring a single skill, for example) seldom exist. Accordingly, it is more appropriate to analyse a Role that a person will fulfil. An example would be a RN Catering Services rating, who is trained in the primary Role but routinely has other Roles and duties aboard ship that are not related to the primary role (such as firefighting and First Aid). Training that person for the job of Catering Services/Fire Fighter/First Aider is impractical, but training that person for the primary Role , then the Role of fire fighter and the First Aider makes more sense.

An assessment of difficulty encountered in carrying out each task, the importance of each task to the achievement of the main job objective and the frequency with which tasks are performed, are key factors in making training decisions and priorities. DIF analysis is a useful technique which contributes to providing a rational basis for making decisions on the design of training which is superior to guesswork or intuition. However, other criteria may be used to decide upon levels of training; including numbers of service personnel performing the task, ease of training within the unit, how soon after training someone is expected to perform the task and how much time is spent performing the task."

A KSA Analysis is a systematic analysis of  Performance  and/or  Standards  in order to identify the necessary KSA required to perform a Role. A KSA Analysis moves on from what the Role holder does (captured in the Role Scalar), to identifying the KSA that have to be learned to perform the task. The results of an Initial KSA Analysis will help with the generation of Training Objectives and Enabling Objectives and the selection of the most appropriate training Methods & Media, during Element 2 (Design). Two examples of Initial KSA Analysis relating to a Role are at Annex A.\n\n14. Knowledge. Knowledge is information acquired through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. Knowledge generally involves recalling information, e.g. the knowledge of rules and regulations, names, sequences, classifications, methodology, events, principles or theories. Whenever a task is performed, knowledge is required. When carrying out a task, a possible pre-requisite is knowledge of:\n\na. When to perform; what are appropriate tactics, techniques, procedures, tools or materials?\n\nb."

It is important to note that a Role PS can refer directly to a requirement for knowledge when it is linked to the practical performance in a Role as stated in the Role PS. KSA Analysis identifies the supporting knowledge required for task performance. Training should only contain knowledge which is essential to the satisfactory performance of a task. For example, where key references are available at the time a task is performed, there may only be a requirement to learn how to access the information rather than learn the contents. Wider knowledge acquisition and application is the remit of education.\n\n16. Skills. A skill is defined as an organised and co-ordinated pattern of mental and/or physical activity.

It would not be possible for the trainee to learn all of these things as facts because too many individual instances exist. The mental skills the trainee learns, therefore, enable them to respond to entire classes of situations, e.g. to make decisions when presented with information and alternative courses of action.\n\nb.

Many tasks performed in Defence can be categorised as having a large physical component, e.g. stripping and assembling a weapon (discrete), flying an aircraft (continuous) and tying a bowline (discrete). Complex physical skills can often be broken down into smaller sub-skills, which can be learned separately and then put together for total performance. An example of this is swimming, which has 3 sub-skills (arm action, leg action and breathing technique), which can be learned and practised separately and then performed as one. More complex skills such as flying/driving, are similarly broken down into their component parts and taught as discrete skills in discrete lessons.\n\n17. Attitudes. An Attitude is a way of thinking and feeling about something, often but not always demonstrated through behaviour. The identification of Standards relating to personal qualities and Attitudes is perhaps the most challenging part of the KSA Analysis."

Attitude is defined as a predisposition resulting in a tendency to act or react in a certain manner when confronted with another person, group, object, situation or idea. It is important to understand that this predisposition to think and feel in a certain way does not necessarily result in observable behaviours. An example of this could be an individual who holds an Attitude that all dogs are dangerous. However, this attitude may not be obvious to others when the individual is handling a dog with which they are familiar and have learned is friendly. Table 2 illustrates how Attitudes can manifest themselves.\n\nAttitudes generally:\n* are learned from experience (or from others);\n* may include thoughts, feelings and behaviours;\n* influence our behaviours towards people or objects;\n* may be stable and persist over time; but\n* can be changed rapidly through experiences, circumstances, education or training.\nAttitudes have three main components:\n* what we think, e.g.  all dogs are dangerous .\n* what we feel,  anxiety or fear near dogs ."

A lecture on computer security may be successful in imparting information on how viruses are transmitted but unless it develops an attitude of security consciousness the trainees may not use the knowledge they have gained on the subject.\n\n19.

This may determine the need for training and the priority given.\nb. How much time is spent on the task? This can sometimes be more important than frequency.\nc. Realism and safety. These considerations may make it impossible to conduct any training. Tasks falling into this category, and how they are dealt with, are covered in the next section (Element 2, Design, 2.2.3, RTGS).\n\nd. Degree of supervision in the workplace. If closely supervised when performing a task, the training category may be reduced since the supervisor can detect errors in- role and then correct them.\n\ne.

TOs form the basis of the detailed design of each of the training lessons as well as identification of appropriate training resources. They may also be used in support of the award of civilian accreditation. Therefore, the development and maintenance of accurate TOs is essential. TOs are drafted during Element 1 and then these draft TOs should be further refined and developed during Element 2 (Design).\n\n2. TOs are precise statements of what tasks a trainee should be able to do, post training, in the Role that the training was designed to prepare them for. A TO is measurable and has three constituents: the Performance required, the Conditions under which the trainee must perform, and the Standard to which the trainee must perform."

For example, constraints on training resources and the availability of real equipment for training may force the emphasis towards workplace training. The same would be true if it is not possible to replicate critical Role PS Conditions in training establishments or via distributed training. Alternatively expensive and scarce training equipment or qualified trainers may only be available in [some] training establishments. It is therefore important to determine an estimate of where the balance between training to be delivered in a training establishment and workplace training will fall. It is based on a careful analysis of exactly what the TRA requires, tempered by that which is deliverable and can only be achieved by consultation with the TRA and the Training Provider, who will have knowledge of existing training and current training facilities and resources. This will later result in the allocation of TOs to a TPS, WTS, or, where no training will take place, the Performance, Conditions and Standards to a RTGS32."

The Method used to deliver training depends on whether learning is categorised as Knowledge, a mental or physical Skill, or an Attitude. Each EO must be examined to determine whether it is primarily expressed as a KSA.

Learning a physical Skill may require equipment and machinery and a low trainee-to-trainer ratio as it tends to be trainee-centric. Knowledge learning is most effective and efficient via e-learning, in the form of a lecture, or with links to information. This works best in a flipped classroom, where learning is then consolidated through discussion.\n\n10. Retention ability. A basic categorisation of training Methods should state that these can either be trainer or learner centric. The appropriate selection of training Methods improves the effectiveness and efficiency of learning. Wherever possible, a learner-focused approach should be adopted although this is not always as simple as it seems as it can be time consuming and resource heavy. A learner-focused approach aids information retention by considering the needs of the trainees and increasing their involvement in the learning process. A trainer-focused approach, whilst increasing trainee-to-trainer ratios, is not as effective for aiding trainee retention. The more active the trainee is in the learning process, the higher the rate of retention."
