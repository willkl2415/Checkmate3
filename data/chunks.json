The volume contains the majority of Defence Learning and Development policies for Elective Education in Defence; where Defence Learning and Development policy sits outside of Volume 9, it is clearly referenced throughout the volume, and in the Document Information chapter in Volume 1. The volume is made up of Direction and Guidance: Policy Directives provides the Direction that must be followed in accordance with statute or policy mandated by Defence or on Defence by Central Government. Policy Guidance provides the Guidance and best practice that will assist the user to comply with the Directives. The volume employs \u2018must\u2019, \u2018should\u2019 and \u2018could\u2019 language as follows: Must: indicates that the policy direction is a legal or key policy requirement and is mandatory.

JSP 822 is the authoritative policy that directs and guides Defence people to ensure that Defence Learning (training and education) is appropriate, efficient, effective and, most importantly, safe. Organisations across Defence have their own policy documents which local policy teams populate and manage, based on their interpretation of the policy contained within JSP 822. Users should consult those policies and policy teams, within their organisation prior to JSP 822 and the TSLD Training Policy Team that manages JSP 822. 1 Note that Organisational Learning is captured under the Defence Organisational Learning Structure (DOLS) Framework owned by Joint Warfare in STRATCOM and is not within the scope of JSP 822.

If the Authority (customer) requires a supplier to have access to additional documentation that is not available on gov.uk, this should be captured within the contract and the onus is with the Authority to ensure that the provider has access to that documentation in accordance with the Information Security policy in JSP 440. If in doubt as to whether documents can be shared with external audiences, the owner of the document must be consulted."

The following definitions provide the scope for this Direction: \u2018Ed Staff\u2019 refers to all RN/RM, Army and RAF education and resettlement staff, including: RN Regional Service Resettlement Advisors, RM Unit Education Officers (UEOs), RN Education and Resettlement Officers (EROs), Learning and Development (Operations) Officers (LDO Ops) and Army Learning and Development Officers (LDOs) ; and Individual Education and Resettlement Officers (IEROs), and RAF Learning Centre and Education Staff. The term \u2018Learning Provider\u2019 (LP) is used to describe any educational or training institutions who deliver courses that may or may not result in the award of a nationally recognised qualification. The term \u2018Learning Purpose\u2019 is used to describe the reason or objective of learning, which could be in direct pursuit of a nationally recognised qualification in order to be eligible for SLC support. There is no restriction on the way the training can be delivered i.e. self-tuition packages, computer-based training, distance learning, informal teach-ins are all acceptable as are more formal classroom-based methods."

For ease, the term SP will be used throughout. AIMS The aims of the SLC scheme are: To provide funding support to SP who wish to enhance their educational or vocational achievements. To enhance the reputation of the MOD, thereby encouraging the recruitment and retention of high-quality SP. FEATURES SLC is a personal development refund scheme and operates as an annualised allowance, available each FY. It does not operate as an account in which the allowance can be carried forward from FY to FY, nor does the scheme permit retrospective payments from previous FY, except in exceptional operational or compassionate circumstances. SLC is paid, as a refund, to SP upon completion of a Learning Purpose. Where SLC courses are due to be completed after the March Payroll and before the end of the FY (ie 31 March) respective SLC claims would normally be processed on 1 Apr and will be applied to the next FYs entitlement. TSLD and the three Service leads for SLC have agreed that should the SP wish to claim SLC against their current FY SLC entitlement they are to gain confirmation, in writing from the appropriate learning provider at the beginning of March, that they have been satisfactorily attending the course and will complete it prior to 31 March. The SP may then submit their SLC claim, in advance of the March Payroll, to their Local Training Manager/Unit HR Administrator for processing within the current FY. The responsibility to obtain the learning providers confirmation and submitting the claim prior to the March Payroll date lies with the SP only (Link to JPA BPG for SLC claims is )."

    "content": "SLC is not an entitlement. Provided SP fulfil the relevant criteria (set out below) they will be eligible to claim SLC support. Eligible SP may claim 80% of fees, up to a maximum of \u00a3175 per FY, paid to LPs for certain personal development courses, examinations and support. This support is provided on a \u2018sharing\u2019 basis reflecting the mutual benefit that personal development brings to the SP and the organisation. SP in receipt of funding will make a personal contribution using their own funds, as well as using off-duty or leave periods for study. Undertaking SLC funded study does not confer duty status and does not count towards Reserve training commitments or bounty arrangements. Eligibility Criteria Before embarking upon an activity for which SLC may be claimed, the SP is to be interviewed by Ed Staff. SP should consider: Relevance of the course, books and training materials, or qualification to their personal development goals and choice of funding. Their ability to cope with the pressures of study (or provision of evidence for assessment), the flexibility of the study method and the risk of disruption, and loss of course fees, by exigencies of Service life."

The SP must demonstrate that the activity will directly benefit the Service unless the activity is being undertaken as preparation for planned resettlement. The proposed activity has substantial developmental value or, where applicable, resettlement content, and is appropriate to the SP personal development needs and within their ability. Evidence the activity is part of a Personal Development Plan (PDP) contained within a Personal Development Record (PDR) will assist in securing this support. SP who claims ELC support may not simultaneously claim SLC support (e.g. SLC may not be used to fund an exam for a course which has been supported by ELC funding). For eligible courses it is permissible for Service Leavers (SL) undergoing resettlement to use the Individual Resettlement Training Cost (IRTC) grant, in addition to SLC. It is permitted, in these circumstances only, for SL to use the IRTC grant to offset, or pay in full, the 20% personal contribution required when using SLC. Allowing SL to use both funding streams ensures that they have the greatest level of flexibility when financing their preferred Learning Purpose."

JSP 822 Volume 8 provides Defence direction and guidance on Skills, Accreditation and Postgraduate study for military personnel. Skills is the common currency which allows Defence to match our organisational needs with the Knowledge, Skills Applications, Experience and Behaviours of our people. The correct implementation of this policy will allow for a more agile force across Defence: surging skilled SP where required; targeted and bespoke career management; enhanced professional growth and personal development; and accurate reward and incentivisation of our SP in recognition of their skills. This policy links to JSP 755, where further background and process for managing skills for career management is contained. Skills Overview Skills Overview The Department for Education\u2019s October 2023 paper on \u2018A Skills Classification for the UK\u20191 states that \u2018Skills\u2019 is a widely used term but with varying definitions of the exact meaning.

Further detail on the management of skills, definitions, and the Pan- Defence Skills Framework (PDSF) is in , Chapter 4. In the Defence Approach, skills are further divided into Functional Skills, Military Skills, Professional Skills and Enterprise Skills as explained below and illustrated in Figure 1. All Military Skills, Professional Skills and Enterprise Skills are underpinned by PDSF. PDSF enables strategic workforce planning, remuneration and reward, workforce management and training and education.2 The intent of this is to benefit SP and Defence. 1 2 Skills are linked to, but are not, competences.3 A competence is the capability to apply knowledge, skills and ability to perform an output. For example, a competence would be qualifications, licenses, or certification of a training output. 4 Skills are enduring and are built on throughout a given SP\u2019s career linked to competences and wider KSEB. Where competences are specifically linked to capability within a given role, skills can be linked across capabilities and built upon with commonalities across Defence.

The complexity of operating in single Service and joint contexts and the need to develop ability through career mean that Military Skills are different to competences (see para. 2.5.1 above).

Meanwhile, competences may contribute to evidence of a level of a proficiency in any given military Skill but their purpose is to demonstrate a specific capability. Principles. Military Skills enable each SP to complete their role within their military environment. These skills provide the fundamental understanding of operating in a specific military context. At the simplest level, it is about each SP understanding their role within their sS in relation to their rank (and role) and how they can achieve it. Military Skills are specific to sS because each sS operates differently, requiring different Military Skills to do so, and different capability (capability covered under competences).

Where external accreditation schemes are publicly funded, external providers are to be selected in accordance with MOD commercial process17. Technical evaluation criteria are to be based upon the principles listed at Annex D. CS should follow the appropriate management, commercial and procurement approval routes, in line with Cabinet Office guidance on external training18."

Where practicable, Defence courses should be mapped entirely, or in part, against the training and education requirements of a professional body. Approach to Accreditation Pre-existing training and education courses. Many existing training courses have elements whose main purpose is to support accreditation. In some cases, these are explicit stand-alone periods whereas in others they have been incorporated through modification of the course content under the original training objectives. It is important that pre-existing accreditation opportunities are not dismantled without viable alternative schemes being offered in their place. Consequently:"

In these circumstances the Accreditation Sponsor must seek the approval of the sS Authorities and the training establishment (receiving the additional funding to extend the course and reflected in the Formal Training Statement). Such an extension should not exceed 10% of the original course length. The remaining elements of schemes that are not gained through the accreditation of courses must be pursued in the work place and/or through personal study and be properly supported. Tracking and transfer of learner records. Effective tracking of learner progress is essential to running successful accreditation schemes with high completion rates. Both Accreditation Sponsors and external providers (where used) must be kept updated with learner contact details to enable progress to be tracked. This is particularly important for SP who will often commence accreditation schemes in a training establishment and then complete them in productive Service. JPA can assist in the tracking of personal qualifications. It is the responsibility of accreditation scheme students to keep both the Accreditation Sponsor and the external provider (where used) updated with their contact details. However, training establishments and units should ensure that SP notify accreditation scheme providers of changing circumstances (including withdrawal, where necessary) as part of routine administrative procedures."

The proportion of off-the-job training must be at least 20%, with the remainder completed as on-the-job training. Apprenticeships are an alternative, practical route into higher education. All employers with a pay bill over \u00a33M pa pay 0.5% of their total pay bill to the HMRC as an apprenticeship levy. This money can then be drawn down to pay for apprenticeships which give the employee a nationally recognised qualification at no cost to the individual. The MOD is one of the largest employer providers of Apprenticeships in England. Apprenticeships are a fundamental part of the offer for our personnel and the programme contributes significantly to the overall skills accreditation provision. TSLD is responsible for the Armed Forces Apprenticeship Programme (AFAP). Head Office\u2019s Civilian HR team manages the MoD\u2019s Civil Service programme. The three single Services run their own schemes and assure their own programmes in and out of the training environment.

It is Defence policy that, where viable, Phase 2 training and subsequent development of workplace competence should be accredited through a relevant apprenticeship, at an appropriate level. New recruits are to be offered the opportunity to commence an appropriate apprenticeship at a minimum of level 2, where a suitable standard exists or can be developed and is a viable way of delivering training. Where an apprenticeship is not available, an alternative qualification should be offered at no cost to the individual. All apprenticeships must have a minimum duration of 12 months. Progression apprenticeships may be offered throughout the SPs career where appropriate but must always be mapped to the role of the individual.

Apprenticeships are offered at several levels as indicated in Table 2. Table 2: Apprenticeship Levels MOD Civil Service Defence offers over 30 different apprenticeship schemes in many professional areas to its Civil Service staff. These schemes can be undertaken by existing staff as a way to upskill and build capability for the department or line managers can recruit apprentices to build a pipeline of new talent and skills for the department. Governance The single Service (sS) and the MOD CS are responsible for delivering their own apprenticeship programmes, and for setting their own requirement. TSLD is responsible for providing overarching strategy for the Armed Services with the support of the sS and CS. TSLD is the lead for engaging with OGDs on behalf of the single Services, in particular the DfE and the Cabinet Office. The sS are therefore to inform TSLD of any engagement with OGDs.

This can be important where Functional Skills (FS) are undertaken as part of an Apprenticeship programme51. Where a minority of learners are more than one level below the level of the course the scheme should only be adopted if it provides support for them to reach this required level before they begin the accreditation scheme52. Recognition by UK Qualification Frameworks. Accredited qualifications should sit within the existing frameworks for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Appropriate to the course level. Courses should be accredited to the highest justifiable and valid level. However, in mapping course components against the requirements of a civilian qualification, the majority must equate to the required level. Where this is not the case a lower qualification should be sought."

Prior to IA, it may be desirable to conduct a quicker but less comprehensive screening or skills check to identify if a SP has difficulties in these areas. The results of screenings should not be used to determine a SP\u2019s level of ability. IA should, where practical, be conducted only once (ideally as part of the recruitment/selection process) with results recorded for subsequent use and placed on JPA. Additional IAs should be considered when a year or more has elapsed and no FS learning programme has been followed. Diagnostic Assessment (DAss). DAss identifies a SP\u2019s specific ability profile and highlights strengths and areas for improvement. This helps to provide a description of learning needs and assists the specialist FS practitioner in the compilation of a learner\u2019s ILP. The ILP is used to outline the short- and longer-term learning targets, the tailored programme to address the English and mathematics needs, as well as a record of progress and achievement. DAss should be conducted in a timely fashion in order for the FS specialist to devise a programme of support that is most appropriate for the needs of the learner."

    "content": "Defence Direction for Specific Learning Differences Policy Sponsor: TSLD, CDP Specific Learning Differences (SpLD) is a term that is used to describe a range of learning differences that are inherent to an individual and which have the potential, to varying degrees, to impact on an individual\u2019s ability to undertake learning and complete tasks within the workplace. Those personnel who may have a SpLD, as part of the wider neurodiversity piece, may bring unique and valuable strengths to their work2, which should be harnessed and embraced by any organisation. SpLDs (Specific Learning Differences), which include Dyslexia, Dyspraxia and Dyscalculia, sit under the neurodiversity umbrella and are part of a wider spectrum of neurodiverse conditions. The term neurodiversity3 describes the range of differences in individual brain function and behavioural traits, regarded as part of normal variation in the human population. SpLDs are not always easy to identify and are sometimes interpreted as poor Skills for Life4. A SpLD can impact on an individual's: organisation; sequencing; memory; auditory and/or visual perception; spoken language; motor skills; and time management. The earlier SpLD are identified the better the support that can be provided, with through career \u2018Learning Support\u2019 as the focus rather than \u2018testing/diagnosis/tracking.\u2019 SP need not be screened for SpLD during the recruitment process, nor is there a requirement to test during initial training (although there is no limitation where single Service (sS) see a benefit). Differences relating to SpLD can manifest at any stage during a career. It is likely SpLD will become apparent at key career change points such as promotion exams or during periods of stress."

The results of an assessment should always lead to an explanation which addresses the issue of why the individual sought advice or was referred for an assessment in the first place.

Consequently, this module, including the Trainee Tracking function, is to be fully implemented by Training Providers as a first priority. Training Analysis Developer (TAD). TAD supports the DSAT analysis & design process for Training Requirement Authorities (TRAs) and (TDA) Course Design Cells (CDCs). Given the effort involved in migrating to TAD, CDCs who are not already using TAD must liaise with TRAs to prioritise the migration to TAD. TAD will automatically populate fields throughout the course folders, such that as the TRA migrates courses, the CDC will be able to access TAD course documentation. Consequently, all training units not already using TAD are to aim to use TAD in its entirety as soon as possible. It is recognised, however, that the migration of large quantities of legacy information into TAD by Training Development Teams (TDTs) and CDCs new to TAFMIS is challenging. As a result, the TAFMIS Team will be available to assist in the change process where needed."

Consideration should be given to Specific Learning Differences, wider disabilities and Digital Literacy of those using and developing training by means of TEL. Additionally, attention should be made towards the potential training and upskilling of trainers and wider support staff on new TEL. Rule 3. Be open and use open source28. If reuse of extant TEL and associated software is not possible, analysis of available license-free TEL must be evident when considering new TEL requirements. Licence free software such as Open Source (code which can be changed without restrictions) and Freeware, offer the opportunity for cost-effective TEL with no on-going licence fees (some Freeware is only available for personal use); however, due consideration must be given to the security of MOD data and systems."

Assurance activity must examine the risk to trainees and staff during the delivery of Defence education and training, and in the transfer of skills to the job role. TLBs should ensure that auditors are empowered to stop training immediately where a significant and imminent risk to life is identified during training delivery, and/or where training shortfalls introduce risk that is not tolerable. Training stopped in this fashion may not recommence until the TRA and TDA have assessed the risk and determined that any necessary recovery plan has been successful. All risks identified by assurance activity are to be recorded by the appropriate Customer Executive Board (CEB) and managed through the CEB process."

This includes Reserve units and units which are delivering distributed Phase 1 and Phase 2 training). 6 For the purpose of this document an \u2018establishment\u2019 is a site made up of one or more training units/schools. It could also refer to a unit which is not a training unit but regularly delivers Phase 1 and Phase 2 training, including Reserve units."

This JSP directs the elements of Care & Welfare that must be provided, as a minimum, within Initial Training establishments (ITE). The Commander must personally own the direction set in their establishments as well as drive continuous improvements to this provision based on evidence of progress of SP available to them. Whilst ownership must be retained at the highest level, everyone in the chain of command has a responsibility for supervisory care. Commanders of ITEs must endeavour to implement this Direction, seeking advice through their sS or TSLD when further clarity is required. Where compliance is not achieved, suitable risk assessment and mitigation should be taken and recorded. 12 The MOD\u2019s definition of Welfare is: The provision of a widely recognised and accessible personal and community support structure that secures and improves the well-being of serving personnel and the Service community, is capable of adapting to societal, legislative and operational change and, in so doing, optimises the military capability and motivation of all Service men and women."

A site comprising multiple schools or units under a common command where the operational purpose of that site is predominantly or entirely to deliver training to personnel. In some cases, multiple schools within a training establishment may have separate commands. Where an establishment has responsibility for more than one school/unit there will be a need for some level of coordinated activity and mechanisms across the establishment which may be based on geographical area rather than independent school/unit activity15.

Although the Services are not in loco parentis, the care & welfare of U18s requires particular attention. Under the provisions of the Children Act 2004, structures have been put in place to ensure the well-being 32 of children and young people.\tThis includes the establishment of a Children\u2019s Commissioner, with a remit independent of Government, to look at all issues concerning those U18.\tThe powers of the Children\u2019s Commissioner include the right of access to any premises in order to interview a child or young person and a right to review the circumstances of children and young people, including any individual cases. Given the unusual nature of service in the Armed Forces (including such things as frequent moves and security), the MOD has agreed a protocol with the office of the Children\u2019s Commissioner. In particular, this focuses all initial contact for any such cases through the MOD Directorate Children and Young People (DCYP), which will facilitate any contact or requirement for cooperation."

Further information and guidance on the roles and responsibilities can be found in JSP 834. Care leavers may not have the family support that others enjoy, and this may make them more at risk. Seeking advice from the single Service welfare services, if required, Commanders must ensure that where they are informed that an U18 is a looked after child or a care leaver, they: offer the support of the single Service welfare services who may also liaise with the appropriate local authority on their behalf if necessary."

Whilst Direction in Chapter 3 relates to the Supervisory Care of all Phase 1 and Phase 2 trainees, the care for U18s is especially sensitive. Commanders should have systems in place to identify and protect those trainees who may be particularly at risk of harassment, bullying or discrimination; those who have personal or welfare problems that could affect their performance or health; and those potentially at risk of radicalisation, self-harm, or suicide33.

This is especially important for those identified as being at risk. A suitable method of informing the gaining unit of any concerns relating to an individual must be established61, so that the gaining unit can ensure that the necessary level of supervisory care is maintained62. This is to ensure that schemes commenced elsewhere are documented and recorded when personnel arrive or return to their unit or establishment.

External Inspection Ofsted84 provides fully independent 3rd Party (i.e. external) assurance through two types of inspection programme; Commissioned (Care & Welfare) inspections requested by Defence via TSLD Statutory (Apprenticeship) inspections required under the Education and Skills Act 2006. The 2 programmes of Commissioned (Care & Welfare) and Statutory (Apprenticeship) inspections are conducted entirely separately, using separate inspection frameworks and visits will not be combined.

Whilst it is emphasised, both in the survey and via the brief at Annex E, that trainees are strongly encouraged to report any serious issues to the appropriate sS authority/local staff, rather than through the RTS/OCS, occasionally comments of concern may continue to be received. Unfortunately, survey completion in the very late stages of training coupled with the time it takes for survey answers to be analysed, anonymised, and fed back to units, often means trainees who have made comments of concern have already moved on to their next phase of training and units are unable to act effectively to rectify any perceived issues. Units are therefore strongly encouraged to reiterate to trainees, immediately on completion of the survey, the options available to trainees through which they can raise issues of concern as detailed in Annex E. If comments of concern are made the TLB Assurance POC will be alerted. TSLD may also be notified."

All new trainees,105 who have completed 28 days\u2019 service and having given 14 days\u2019 notice, have a right to discharge within the first 6 months of service106. Discharge U18 (DU18). After the first 6 months of service, all Service personnel U18 retain a right to claim discharge up to their 18th birthday. The terms of this discharge include a cooling-off period and are therefore different to those for DAOR. Service personnel U18 who, after 6 months\u2019 service, wish to leave their Service must give notice in writing and before their 18th birthday to their Commander. U18s will not be discharged until the end of a cooling-off period107. The maximum cooling-off period will be 3 months. This may be reduced but only if both the Commander and the U18 agree to a shorter cooling-off period. Once an U18 has submitted an application to leave, the longest period that an individual will be required to continue to serve is 3 months. The cooling-off period provides the safeguard of a period for reflection in which the U18 may rescind a hasty and subsequently regretted decision. An U18 who has notified their Commander of their intention to leave will not be discharged if they change their mind about leaving before the date of their discharge108. The U18 should normally notify their Commander of their wish to change their mind by submitting a withdrawal of notice; the U18 must then be allowed to remain in Service. Commanders retain the power to discharge a Service person regardless of age for other reasons, but they should generally not consider individuals unsuitable because they have previously exercised the right both to apply for discharge and to remove that notice. Commanders are to ensure that all Service personnel U18 are made aware of their right to discharge."

As a consequence, care leavers represent a \u2018special group with specific needs\u2019 and extra sensitivity is required. The relevant local authority is to be contacted and appropriate arrangements made for the return of the U18 to their care.

U18s are not to be deployed on UN peacekeeping operations in line with UN policy. In addition to general safeguarding principles, the following steps are to be taken to ensure that members of the Armed Forces who have not reached the age of 18 do not take a direct part in hostilities or are not put at risk from exposure to hostilities. In particular, when a unit is about to deploy to a potentially hostile situation and an individual U18 cannot be retained as part of the Unit Rear Ops Group, they are to be removed from such unit unless: it is not practicable to do so; or to do so would undermine the operational effectiveness of that individual\u2019s unit and put at risk the successful completion of the military mission and/or the safety of other personnel. Decisions on the removal of U18s from units will be made whenever the appropriate Service commanders, in concert with the Chief of Joint Operations, consider there is a greater than low probability of members of the unit having to take a direct part in, or be put at risk by, hostilities. The decision to retain U18s in units which having been deployed in benign circumstances, find themselves in a rapidly worsening operational scenario, lies with the Commander, but must be based on the same criteria as above, i.e. an immediate presumption of removal if feasible. Commanders are to adhere to single Service rules on deployment and posting of U18s overseas113."

The volume contains the majority of Defence Learning and Development policies for Collective Training in Defence; where Defence Learning and Development policy sits outside of Volume 3, it is clearly referenced throughout the volume, and in the Document Information chapter in Volume 1. The volume is made up of Direction and Guidance: Policy Directives provides the Direction that must be followed in accordance with statute or policy mandated by Defence or on Defence by Central Government. Policy Guidance provides the Guidance and best practice that will assist the user to comply with the Directives. The volume employs \u2018must\u2019, \u2018should\u2019 and \u2018could\u2019 language as follows: Must: indicates that the policy direction is a legal or key policy requirement and is mandatory. Should: indicates the policy guidance is a recommendation. Although not compulsory, if a decision is made that any part of this policy cannot be complied with, then the Senior Responsible Owner who is ultimately responsible for that decision must thereby own and manage the inherent risks that arises."

AIM This policy sets strategic Direction for the conduct of Collective Training, driving coherence across Military Commands (MCs) and codifying processes in support of force generation, preparation and sustainment. It also places Collective Training at the centre of managing risk to contingent capability and sets priorities to deliver improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of collective training. COLLECTIVE TRAINING DEFINITION The Training Defence Line of Development (DLOD) provides the means to develop, practice and validate, with constraints, the practical application of a common military doctrine to deliver a military capability. Training consists of individual and collective training on a progressive spectrum (See Figure 1); they are interlinked and mutually dependent2."

Figure 1: Individual and Collective Training Continuum Collective Training is any training activity focussed on the collective performance of two or more people working together that improves the ability of teams, large or small, to work together in order to generate the forces required for operations. Collective Training is collective only when the team as a whole is assessed on its collective performance. PURPOSE OF COLLECTIVE TRAINING Effective Collective Training is critical to the successful achievement of operational effect through the generation, and maintenance, of Force Elements at Readiness (FE@R).

METHODS OF COLLECTIVE TRAINING Collective Training is usually, but not exclusively, delivered through exercises4 but can also occur through other methods such as platform or simulator drills and scenarios. Collective Training can utilise Live, Virtual or Constructive training environments \u2013 or a blend between the three. Different contexts for Collective Training are utilised according to the Collective Training Tier being conducted (see Table 1 below) and the Primary and Secondary Training Audiences (PTA/STA) being trained. 3 Para 3, Pg. iii, DOC Assessment 19/05: An Assessment of Defence Collective Training. 4 An exercise is a time bound and chronologically sequenced series of scenarios (simulated, live or a combination) that provide a realistic narrative within which the principal learning and assessment activities take place.

Training should be delivered as it was planned, with the correct training facilities, suitably qualified and experienced training staff and with the correct procedures and instructions. Undue pressure should not be put on managers or those delivering training to deviate from planned and endorsed training programmes. Those responsible for the management and delivery of training should have the ability to amend training as necessary, to meet changing environmental conditions (e.g. avoiding excessive heat), equipment deficiencies or shortfalls in resources. However, careful consideration must be given to the resultant risk, especially where it has an impact on safety that increases the risk to life and could result in death or serious injury. It is imperative that the delivery of training remains progressive and subject to a safe system of training throughout. Changes to planned training delivery such as truncating, accelerating or other variations (changing location, time or content etc) can affect the rate at which training proficiency is achieved, potentially increasing the associated risk. In many cases certain proficiency criteria must be met by trainees to be able to perform tasks in a consistent, reliable and repeatable manner that meets established standards, facilitating the progression in training and enabling post training activities. This is of paramount importance for any critical training which, if not conducted to the correct standard, increases the risk to life and could result in death or serious injury. Any change to the content, time or resources available for such critical training must be subject to an approved risk assessment by the Commander, Line Manager or accountable person."

It contains all the information needed to conduct a valid assessment including the type of assessment, marking details, pass/fail criteria for the assessment of CTOs and the consequences of failure. Trainers should always use an up-to-date ASpec when planning an assessment. The main purpose of the ASpec is to control what is assessed and how. Trainers must assess all of the EOs and KLPs as specified in the ASpec and not make any changes that alter these. The manner in which the assessment is conducted is determined by the ASpec. Designers strive to provide as much realism as possible, sometimes by using simulation, instrumented or scenario-based activities and so unauthorised changes to the realism of a practical assessment may make it invalid. If limited resources make it difficult to deliver the assessment in the recommended way or the ASpec appears too restrictive, the DTS, DTM or Chain of Command should be informed."

Whilst the generic guidance on assessment of learning is relevant for all training, there are some special considerations for the workplace training environment. The proper conduct of assessments in the workplace is critical to the assurance of Defence outputs, since it requires making a judgement on team performance and progress and to decide on whether they are sufficiently competent in a particular task to be qualified to work without supervision. Trainers should be able to administer assessments in a fair, valid and reliable manner according to the specifications provided. This is particularly important because workplace assessments may not be conducted under the same conditions that would usually be expected in more structured training environment. Types of assessment. Workplace assessments are generally practical in nature and are used to test individuals or teams in the achievement of a Skill, or Skills, both mental and physical. They can assess either the product of the Skill or the process involved in employing the Skills and should have an associated checklist to ensure both reliability and objectivity in assessment. The WTS will often require the trainees to be assessed on a Skill that has already been practised and assessed in a simulated environment, but which now needs to be confirmed in a live environment. It is important that workplace assessments are conducted in a context that properly reflects the real challenges of the Role or Task. Workplace assessments can be either formative or summative. The detail of what should be assessed and how it should be assessed is contained within the training documentation and should include:"

AARs are usually conducted at natural pauses in the tempo of an exercise or collective training event and are often conducted \u2018in the field\u2019 by the collective trainers (also known as Observers or Mentors). Occasionally, the AAR process is confused with an informal or unprepared \u2018de-brief\u2019 where the mechanics of the collective training event undertaken are explained but its relevance, or otherwise, to the CTOs, Mission Task List (MTL) or doctrine is often missed. Also, there is a view that AARs rely solely on the subjective opinion, experience and judgement of the collective trainer, rather than a sound and well-developed series of objectively assessable CTOs. Therefore, the Training Provider should ensure that AARs are used as a mechanism to assess trainees against a specified Standard. An AStrat with ASpecs should be developed for collective training events and the AAR process should be used to implement them in order to ascertain if the team has achieved the required Standard as laid out in the CTOs.

This risk implies that a generated force, Force Element (FE) or team is not ready to undertake untrained tasks. Any risk owing to a failure of one or more assessments. This risk implies that a generated force, FE or team has been trained but is not wholly competent to undertake certain tasks. Figure 11: Risk Management of Collective Training Certification of collective training. Certification of collective training confirms the achievement of force generation and is conducted by the TRA99 in order to ensure that a force or FE can be deployed and that any associated risks are accepted.

Commands may use different authorities to certify achievement of force generation but in all circumstances the allocation of certification responsibilities must be clear and agreed with the TRA, with any risk accepted. Management of Training Deficiency Management of training deficiency \u2013 3.5. Managing risks to the trained output (i.e. the Teamwork Description of the teams undergoing collective training) is different from assessing and managing risks associated with the Training System. The responsibility for the management of training deficiency lies with the Training Provider. Where risks or issues resulting from identified training deficiencies cannot be mitigated by the Training Provider such training deficiency-based risks should be elevated for treatment or toleration etc. Identifying and raising training deficiencies shows the stakeholders where training shortfalls exist or where risks have been taken owing to either an inability to train certain CTOs (due to weather constraints or equipment casualties, for example) or a training failure that has been picked up through the assurance process. Such deficiencies suggest that teams may not hold the competences that the training should have delivered. These are essentially unplanned but unavoidable training gaps which should therefore be captured, and the appropriate governance body informed so that a decision can be made to treat, tolerate or transfer the training deficiency. A Training Deficiency is not the same as the Residual Training Gap. The Residual Training Gap is agreed by the TRA early on in the DSAT process and is articulated in the RTGS."

Whilst the TNE is the final part of the CTNA process (Element 1), it is discussed in this part of the JSP as it is an evaluation activity. The purpose of the TNE is to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the CTNA process and the training solution that was recommended at the end of Stage 2 (Analysis). First, it should evaluate the CTNA process by identifying areas for improvement, learning lessons and seeking to tailor the CTNA methodology through the process of CI. Second, it should evaluate the recommendation by reviewing the training solution it proposed. The rationale for this is that it may be some time (years) after the Training Needs Report (completed at the end of Element 1 (CTNA Stage 2, 1.7) is published that the TRA will once again be in a position to evaluate the recommended training solution and the CTNA process by which it was generated. Implementation and management of the TNE outputs (likely to be recommendations to improve both current and future CTNA processes as well as the current Training System) will depend upon the nature of the CTNA processes used and the resultant Training System, but the strategy for the TNE should have been included in the Training Needs Report.

A written test may well test whether the team knows what to do in a practical task but not if they can actually do it. Reliability. A measuring instrument is reliable if it gives consistent results.

Detailed guidance on a range of EBT methods is given to trainers during the Defence Trainer course and is available on the Defence Trainer DLE. Coaching. The purpose of using coaching techniques is to unlock a team\u2019s potential in order to improve and maximise performance. It is about helping teams learn for themselves rather than delivering training to them. Coaching techniques form an integral part of the trainer\u2019s toolbox. Everything should be geared towards ensuring that teams are successful. Often that simply means responding positively and constructively to their efforts and setting new challenges for them. There will also be times when a more focused approach is needed (e.g. to develop a team that is struggling, or to motivate a team that is finding training too easy). Coaching techniques form the basis of the Defence trainer course, and of learner-centric training to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of training are maximised."

    "content": "Self-regulated learning: Making training learner-centred also encourages teams to self-regulate their learning, i.e. they monitor their own knowledge and skills and make decisions on how they can progress. Teams who self-regulate their learning are motivated to learn through-life and are confident of their ability to learn, and so they are more likely to take action to remain competent and current in their job role. Trainers can teach teams to self-regulate by prompting them to set and reflect on individual goals, using feedback to then identify and review what they did to achieve the goal. Concentrating more on what the team did (or did not do), rather than the actual outcome, helps to develop these self-monitoring capabilities. Learning from mistakes is also a very effective tool in self- regulated learning and teams need to be given the freedom to make mistakes where safety, time and resources permit. The DTCF sets out the requirement for \u201clearning events to meet both organisational and individual goals\u201d in Competency Group 2 and the requirement for trainees to \u201cset realistic personal goals based on self- assessment and constructive feedback\u201d in Competency Group 4.

The retention of Knowledge and Skills over time is moderated or influenced by how often the task is performed or practised. Table 2 shows the impact of task performance frequency on the retention of the different types of Knowledge and Skills. For example, if discrete psychomotor skills are performed very frequently then the retention level is High. However, if performed infrequently then the retention level is reduced to moderate. Table 2: Effect of Task Frequency on Knowledge/Skill Retention The retention level of the Knowledge and Skills for a given task should be taken into account when setting refresher training intervals. Further guidance on refresher training analysis is available from the Competence Retention Analysis Technique (CRAT) User Guide. It is important to note that a number of role-related factors (in addition to frequency of task performance) can also influence Knowledge and Skill fade, e.g. designing equipment, job aids and operating procedures in accordance with good practice (which includes built-in user feedback for equipment and interfaces, logical steps within procedures)."

Training is one of the numerous factors that the Service Commands (SC) must consider when making decisions on Defence Capability. These factors are collectively known as the Defence Lines of Development (DLODs) and are used to ensure Defence Capability is delivered. Individual Training is training designed to develop a mix of Knowledge, Skills, Experience and Behaviours (KSE-B) of individuals.  It takes place in any environment, conforms to a Defence Systems Approach to Training (DSAT) generated Training System, has suitable training governance processes in place, and can utilise a variety of Methods & Media. The DSAT process comprises activities relating to the analysis, design, delivery and assurance of all Defence training, across the Whole Force.

It will direct the mandated management, governance and assurance activities that must be undertaken during the life of any Defence individual training activity. Integral to the 4 elements of analysis, design, delivery and assurance is the need to ensure that the DSAT process and the resultant Training System is properly governed and managed and meets the high standards required for training in Defence. The governance, management and assurance (DSAT, Element 4) of training are collectively known as a MTS.  A MTS is an iterative mechanism to ensure that the training being delivered remains meaningful and continues to contribute to delivering Defence effect. The outputs of the DSAT Elements, combined with the correct implementation of the MTS, delivers a Training System that meets the required Quality Management Standard (QMS).   For the MTS to be effective, bodies such as boards and working groups must be established to ensure that the DSAT process remains on track and the Training System remains appropriate to the need."

    "content": "As an integral part of the MTS, activities that directly contribute to meeting the QMS are also embedded within each Element.  The MTS mostly draws in products from the DSAT process (to avoid duplication) in order to record and demonstrate that the QMS is being met.  All stakeholders of the Training System will have some involvement in the MTS. Where, for organisational, contractual, or other reasons, activities are distributed and/or responsibilities delegated other than as recommended, then this should be agreed at the CEB and annotated on the TrAD.  In all cases, any variance from the MTS must still be DSAT QMS compliant and auditable. Roles / Stakeholders There are many different users of the DSAT process who are pivotal to ensuring the MTS is fulfilled.  Key personnel or Roles involved, which are recorded on the Training Authorisation Document (TrAD), are covered within this section. The Training Requirements Authority Training Requirements Authority (TRA).  The TRA represents the end-user of the trained output and is the ultimate authority for the derivation and maintenance of the Role Performance Statement (Role PS) and/or Framework(s).  The TRA is responsible for the evaluation of the effect of the training in achieving the Role PS and/or Framework(s) wherever the training is delivered.  The TRA often sits at the Service Command (SC) level and sets the requirement for a new training activity, or a variation to an existing one, as well as some aspects of the assurance of the training. The TRA is often a nominated post at 2* level but it is common practice for TRA responsibilities to be delegated, by letter, to an individual (or organisation) who has more knowledge of the specific requirement."

Analysis of Individual Training Introduction This chapter provides Direction and Guidance on the processes and outputs associated with the production of a T-DLOD needs analysis, in the form of a Training Needs Analysis (TNA), which is Element 1 of the DSAT process. The DSAT process allows training specialists to adopt a structured, methodical approach to the analysis of the T-DLOD need, or requirement.  It sets out the various activities, collectively termed the TNA, which may be used in order to conduct a TNA, which informs subsequent Elements and forms part of the overall Training System. TNA.  A TNA is a structured analysis of training need arising as a result of new equipment acquisition, doctrinal change, organisational change, or changes to policy/legislation It is a highly flexible procedure with the choice of supporting tools and techniques to suit different Training Systems. It typically includes an analysis of different training Methods and technologies, with a view to recommending the optimum training solution to meet Defence needs and which balances cost and quality.   In all cases, however, a TNA is an output based, iterative process that provides an audit trail for all decisions and is closely mapped to the requirements of the QMS.  A TNA does not, and should not, imply that training will be the only solution.  If training is not the solution, this will become apparent in the Planning Stage, after which, analysis activity will cease. It should be noted that a TNA may range from a simple interview to a process lasting several months."

Options can be assessed via several criteria: The extent to which the option meets the requirements. Through-life cost, including the costs of maintenance, trainers and integration with existing training locations/environments. Implementation time, which may prove important to meet an operational need or a RFTD (1.1.1). Trainer load, or any consideration of the availability and competence of trainers to support training.

Learning in the workplace is just as important as learning on a course and requires the support of qualified trainers.

Training provision is the process conducted by the Training Provider that enables and allows trainees to learn.

The Training Provider is ultimately responsible to the TDA, the TRA and Customer for the work conducted during this Element. Training should be delivered as it was planned, with the correct training facilities, suitably qualified and experienced training staff and with the correct procedures and instructions. Undue pressure should not be put on managers or those delivering training to deviate from planned and endorsed training programmes. Those responsible for the management and delivery of training should have the ability to amend training as necessary, to meet changing environmental conditions (e.g. avoiding excessive heat), equipment deficiencies or shortfalls in resources. However, careful consideration must be given to the resultant risk, especially where it has an impact on safety that increases the risk to life and could result in death or serious injury. It is imperative that the delivery of training remains progressive and subject to a safe system of training throughout. Changes to planned training delivery such as truncating, accelerating or other variations (changing location, time or content etc) can affect the rate at which training proficiency is achieved, potentially increasing the associated risk. In many cases certain proficiency criteria must be met by trainees to be able to perform tasks in a consistent, reliable and repeatable manner that meets established standards, facilitating the progression in training and enabling post training activities. This is of paramount importance for any critical training which, if not conducted to the correct standard, increases the risk to life and could result in death or serious injury. Any change to the content, time or resources available for such critical training must be subject to an approved risk assessment by the Commander, Line Manager or accountable person."

This includes the use of the LSpec and ASpec to generate lesson or event plans and assessments suitable to the training environment.  Consideration should also be given to the development of a remedial training strategy. The effectiveness of training delivery will be measured by the Training Provider and appropriate governance body according to whether the intended outcomes (the TOs) have been achieved successfully.  This is determined through the formal assessment process, but there will also be other, indirect outcomes of training (e.g. motivation to learn and creating independent learners) which will need to be considered when planning and preparing effective training.  These are not as easy to measure, but they are important if trainees are to perform to the best of their ability."

These are essentially unplanned but unavoidable training gaps which should therefore be captured, and the appropriate governance body informed so that a decision can be made to treat, tolerate or transfer (to the receiving unit) the training deficiency. A Training Deficiency is not the same as the Residual Training Gap.  The Residual Training Gap is agreed by the TRA early on in the DSAT process and is articulated in the RTGS."

For detailed policy on the Audit and Inspection activities that make up Element 4, see JSP 822, Volume 5. Assurance is an all-encompassing term used to describe the evaluation, audit and inspection activities of the Training System.  These activities are conducted by most stakeholders including those internal to the Training System as well as by bodies external to it (thus ensuring independence and a lack of bias).  Assurance activities do not focus solely on the provision of training (although this is a key activity) but also on the DSAT process and the Training System as a whole, including the MTS.  In addition to evaluation, audit and inspection, Element 4 activities include: Stage 3 of the TNA (TNE) and other governance and management processes that are key to the MTS.  Assurance activities are detailed in the TQM which is endorsed at the CEB.  The DSAT QMS is key to assisting those involved in the assurance of Defence training.  The DSAT QMS is the standard that is met when the outputs of the DSAT Elements and the MTS activities are implemented correctly.  DSAT assurance needs to focus on the mandated requirements of the MTS and the mandated requirements of individual training. Information, which must be managed iaw JSP 441, will support the assurance process."

Defence Trainer Capability Introduction Training and education of people is a key enabler in delivering Defence Missions and must be agile to the rapidly changing contexts and demands. Defence seeks to maximise talent through training and education and building a sustainable diverse and skilled workforce for the future. Defence must meet the expectations of the workforce and both motivate and engage people. Defence training and education therefore has a pivotal role in delivering this People Strategy and it is underpinned by a robust and effective Defence Trainer Capability (DTC). House of Commons Defence Committee (HCDC) Inquiries, audit reports and research provide evidence that safety in training must remain paramount, with risks reduced to as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) and tolerable. In response to report findings, the DTC was initiated in 2014. DTC professionalises the training cadre and through its robust governance and assurance processes ensures that all Defence trainers, trainer supervisors and training managers are suitably qualified and experienced. It outlines the requirement for a professional development pathway to continuously meet the required quality standard and competence and attracts externally recognised national qualifications."

In addition, induction courses at initial training establishments are to brief the local instructors that seek to implement this Direction.  Equally, COs are to ensure that all personnel (military, civilian and contractors) in contact with Phase 1 recruits and Phase 2 trainees are aware of their responsibilities in the application of this RT Direction. Defence Direction on Robust Training Policy Sponsor: TSLD, CDP Introduction Properly conducted Robust Training is a basic principle of training in Defence and as such is linked to measurable Training Objectives (TOs) and outcomes.  It is deliberately designed to induce an element of pressure in order to challenge recruits and trainees mentally and physically, so that they draw on reserves of willpower and stamina to achieve the outcome sought.  The aim therefore of Robust Training events is to develop physical and mental resilience in order to prepare appropriately for the challenges of operations worldwide.  It is entirely practical to deliver such training without compromising welfare and Duty of Care responsibilities, but it must be regulated to prevent Robust Training being replaced with harsh or inappropriate training that prevents the overall training effect from being delivered."

    "content": "This Defence Direction assists Commanders involved in all phases of training, in planning appropriate and proportionate training that is challenging, engaging and robust, whilst ensuring that risks are identified and mitigated, so that the recruit or trainee is protected from uncontrolled misuse of the term to deliver harsh training, unlinked to a specified training outcome or objective.  Commanders should consider this Direction in conjunction with the \u2018Commanders Managing the Training Environment\u2019 Direction and the \u2018Supervisory Care for Phase 1 Recruits and Phase 2 Trainees\u2019 Direction and the Safe System of Training.  Both are contained within this JSP as are other policies relevant to ensuring a realistic and safe training environment.  In addition, all training should be designed and delivered in line with the Direction given in this JSP. Purpose and Application.  The purpose of Robust Training is to progressively develop a Service Person\u2019s (SPs) resilience to enable them to perform effectively in any operational environment.  The degree to which Robust Training is employed within an Initial training programme should reflect the employment of that SP in both specialist and generic tasks.  Emphasis should be placed upon the need for SP to perform in the most demanding conditions in which they may realistically expect to find themselves if deployed to high-tempo and/or high-threat operational environments.  As Defence transitions to a contingent posture, the non-linear nature of the Contemporary Operating Environment (COE) will inevitably expose SP from support functions to higher risks than would have traditionally been the case.  It is therefore no longer acceptable to have a situation where combat personnel and support or service support personnel sit at distant ends of a wide spectrum of individual resilience.  This gap should be narrowed if all SP are to be best prepared for operational service.  This requires moral courage to implement and there is a need for a coherence of approach across Defence and single Service (sS) training establishments to ensure that Robust Training is systematic, progressive and appropriately contextualised."

    "content": "PRINCIPLES Beneficial.  The net result of properly designed and conducted Robust Training should be beneficial to recruits and trainees in a resilience context.  It should develop their ability to perform demanding tasks under difficult conditions by building self-confidence, self-reliance and motivation.  It must not erode it.  Recruits and trainees should feel that the training was a positive experience.  This point in itself is a useful to guide to whether Robust Training events are having the desired effect and should be measured as part of a training establishment\u2019s self-assessment process. Developmental.  Robust Training tasks must be developmental and preparative in nature and related to performance expected after training.  Robust Training should take place under simulated operational conditions where possible and/or appropriate.  Recruits and trainees must be sufficiently prepared for the training and, while it should stretch and test their abilities, it must not make them feel that they have no chance of performing adequately.  Consequently, the effect should be to take recruits and trainees out of their comfort zone and to develop resilience and self-reliance so they can be assured that they are well prepared to handle challenging situations."

    "content": "Tailored.  Due to the wide range of training in Defence and the breadth of job specifications within both commissioned and non-commissioned ranks, what could be defined as Robust Training for one training cohort may not be suitable or appropriate for another.  While many operational conditions are similar for all, it is unlikely that any but the most generic of Robust Training events will be appropriate across Defence.  Robust Training must be designed to be relevant to the roles and duties of the recruit or trainee and likely employment on operations.  Robustness comes in many forms, both physical and mental.  sS and Defence training establishments need to implement a \u2018continuum of robustness\u2019 that threads through all phases of training, and which must be: Relevant.  sS training has spent the last decade or more delivering capability to defined operational theatres with (largely) understood threats.  As Defence returns to contingency the certainty of future operational environments and the threats that emerge may be less defined and less clearly understood.  This uncertainty requires a refinement within training if we are to produce a new generation of robust, self-sufficient and capable SP."

It is necessary to replicate the physical and mental pressures of operations that are specific to Service and role, noting the need to ensure that supporting personnel should also build resilience through Robust Training.  If all SP are to be best prepared for operational service, training needs to focus on the increased resilience end of the spectrum and where possible enhance the psychological stressors in training (e.g. increased use of battle simulation, additional night training scenarios) and the physical stressors (e.g. extending training days, more time living \u2018in the field\u2019 or austere simulated operational conditions). Delivered to defined standards.  The ability to measure how successfully sS deliver training that challenges a recruit or trainee to develop physical and mental resilience should be achieved via measures of performance whilst in Initial training, and through measures of effect once SP join their respective Commands.  Detailed assessment through both InVal and ExVal will be essential in determining the degree to which Robust Training is succeeding."

It must be proportionate to the delivery of the defined operational output.  There is both a moral obligation to prepare recruits and trainees appropriately for the rigours of operational Service, and a need to recognise that a Robust Training regime may lead to injury, increased wastage rates or litigation.  These factors are not mutually opposing or irreconcilable.  Robust Training can be delivered during all phases of training whilst successfully discharging Defence\u2019s welfare and Duty of Care responsibilities.  The risks associated with Robust Training must be identified, assessed and addressed with a view to enabling this important element of training.  A culture of risk aversion must be avoided as it merely transfers risk to the Commands and is morally unjustifiable.  It is incumbent upon Commanders, their staff and trainers to be conversant with the principles and application of risk assessment at their respective levels of training command.  Intelligent risk management must be led by the Commander and understood by all staff involved in training delivery.  The first step in developing risk management locally will be through the CRA/SCD process.  Detailed briefing on local procedures must be included in staff/trainer induction training and understanding must be developed further through regular study periods"

The level and style of supervision needs to be tailored to the level of risk, the type of training and the ability and confidence of the recruits or trainees. Trust in the Chain of Command.  The application of Robust Training may be compromised, at least in part, by a mutual lack of trust between training staff and their Chains of Command.  This can be compounded by a perception amongst trainers that there has been a shift in emphasis to the recruit\u2019s or trainee\u2019s care needs that conflict with challenging, engaging and robust training.  Recruits and trainees must be empowered to ask questions and appropriately challenge the \u2018recruiting promise.\u2019\u00a0 This should not, however, be viewed as a challenge to the core tenets of sS Values, Standards and Ethos, or the Chain of Command.  Trust needs to be established early so that there is an understanding of what is required and the rationale behind Robust Training. Good Practice Compliance with Defence training standards.  Robust Training events must be designed in accordance with the DSAT.  They must be shaped logically to fulfil and test an established training need and must be conducted consistently and resourced appropriately.  All training, including events that are designed to be robust must be designed to deliver against the Role PS and/or Framework(s), as set out by the TRA.  Robust Training must have a defined TO to achieve and be measured against.  Robust Training for its own ends, delivered ad hoc, in an uncontrolled manner or unsupervised environment is dangerous and must be actively guarded against.  Adherence to JSP 822 allows challenging, engaging and robust training to be designed and delivered in a safe, controlled and appropriately governed manner."

    "content": "Appropriate risk management not excessive risk aversion.  It is generally accepted that military Service will expose SP to more risk than most civilian occupations.  Training to meet the needs of military Service, which stretches recruits and trainees physically and psychologically, ideally under simulated operational conditions, is likely to carry more training risk than is normally the case.  Commanders and training staff must ensure that all risks are assessed and mitigated, but they must not seek to unnecessarily protect recruits and trainees from the consequence of failing to rise to the challenges set.  It is acknowledged that this element will need to draw upon the experience and judgement of the training Chain of Command.  It is vital to avoid the inculcation of a culture of risk aversion that may lead to the physical or psychological inability to perform adequately when facing the challenge of operational conditions. Separated from remedial action.  It is important that training staff designing and delivering Robust Training must ensure that recruits and trainees as well as training staff understand the purpose and intended outcome of the training.  It must be clearly differentiated from any sort of remedial training, corrective or disciplinary action.  Training that is intended to be robust must not be confused with any form of bullying, harassment or intimidation.  Such conduct is wholly unacceptable and contrary to Defence\u2019s Values, Standards and Ethos and the DHALI/B intent, and is demonstrably counter-productive in developing resilience.  Effective supervisory care, welfare policies and governance and assurance processes will ensure that Robust Training is not confused with, or replaced by, actions or events that either serve a different remedial, corrective or disciplinary purpose, or those that are conducted in a misguided attempt to achieve unsanctioned, unacceptable and unnecessary outcomes."

The conduct of Robust Training events must not undermine the good practice and culture of Continuous Improvement that is synonymous with DSAT and DHALI/B.  It is possible to prevent confusion amongst recruits and trainees by detailed explanation of Robust Training aims and objectives during induction and regularly thereafter.  Trainers must have the principles of Robust Training explained to them during their selection, training and again when they join the training establishment.  Where inexperienced staff or trainers are expected to apply Robust Training techniques they must be mentored and supervised. Examples of Robust Training Factors Ideally, Robust Training should not be confined to specific and stand-alone events; it must be all pervasive, coherent and progressive throughout all phases of training.  In its most basic form, Robust Training may simply be reflected through the setting of unremitting high standards by staff, trainers and support personnel."

It will also explain the purpose of the DSAT QMS and how a robust MTS will assist in meeting that standard. What is MTS? Integral to the 4 Elements of analysis, design, delivery and assurance is the need to ensure that the DSAT process and the resultant Training System is properly governed and managed and meets the high standards required for training in Defence. The governance, management, and assurance (Element 4) of training are collectively known as an MTS. An MTS is an iterative mechanism (supported by documented products and processes) to ensure that the training being delivered remains meaningful and continues to contribute to delivering Defence effect. When delivered correctly, the outputs of the DSAT Elements, combined with the MTS, deliver a Training System that meets the required QMS."

The MTS mostly draws in products from the DSAT process in order to record and demonstrate that the QMS is being met and avoid duplication. All stakeholders in the Training System will have some involvement in the MTS. What is a Training System? A Training System, therefore, comprises the analysis, design and delivery of training along with the governance, management and assurance activities.

Defence people work in hazardous environments, under stressful conditions whilst conducting activities that carry a high risk to personal safety. Consequently, Defence must ensure that its Training Systems meet the very highest standards. Training must also be robust, realistic, and challenging if it is to prepare its personnel for the full spectrum of Defence Roles. However, there is a tendency, because of the risk, for Defence training organisations to provide more training than necessary in the misguided belief that this will make up for future uncertainties. And, in some cases, poorly designed or executed Training Systems can deliver insufficient training. The ideal then is a Training System that is designed to train its personnel to an optimal level so that they are equipped with the appropriate Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes (KSA). Providing too much training costs money that will likely be taken from elsewhere in the training budget that could then result in insufficient training in other areas, which risks lives. Therefore, a Training System designed using a common process and that is governed and managed in accordance with the Defence mandated QMS, is vital to ensure that Defence people are best equipped to achieve Defence effect."

This enables Defence to meet the training imperative set by the Operational Requirement, whilst ensuring that personnel given the best possible preparation for the roles they may undertake. The SST enables Defence to maintain training risks at As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) by ensuring those who conduct the training are competent and that all risks, and associated mitigation measures have been considered.

    "content": "Furthermore, for all training activities, dynamic risk assessments are to be conducted before or during activities in response to changing or unexpected conditions. This will allow training to be paused, amended, or stopped as necessary. 26 See JSP 892 for Defence Risk Management Policy. Cumulative Risk It is not sufficient to merely monitor risks, but all involved must be aware of the possibility and impact of cumulative risk. This may occur within a training day or training course as activities are changed and amended, with the trainer or supervisor required to keep track of the impact on safety as well as the training standard and welfare of all those involved. Cumulative risk incorporates other areas such as support and management, where there is no longer the capacity to maintain the existing training or update it to meet changing requirements (e.g. input standards) or fully implement the recommendations from reviews. For example, the informal act of a changing task (change in task complexity, omitting a particular step, changing the conditions set out in the planned activity) - although necessary, may have introduced additional risks that were not recognised- either in facilitating training, or in the need for suitable progression for the trainees. In addition, gapping in the training support area may mean this change is never updated in the DSAT mandated documentation and hence it is not reviewed and authorised. Operational pressures and resource constraints may then mean this shortfall is continually repeated in several areas and informal changes become normalised: the training delivered may be required but does not match the authorised and documented instructions and procedures being managed and resourced. Such cumulative risk must be recognised, escalated through the chain of command, and actioned as necessary."
